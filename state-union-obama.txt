madame speaker mr. vice president members of congress and the first
lady of the united states
i've come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and
women in this great chamber but to speak frankly and directly to the
men and women who sent us here
i know that for many americans watching right now the state of our
economy is a concern that rises above all others and rightly so if
you haven't been personally affected by this recession you probably
know someone who has a friend a neighbor a member of your
family you don't need to hear another list of statistics to know that
our economy is in crisis because you live it every day it's the
worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights it's the
job you thought you'd retire from but now have lost the business you
built your dreams upon that's now hanging by a thread the college
acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope the
impact of this recession is real and it is everywhere
but while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken
though we are living through difficult and uncertain times tonight i
want every american to know this
we will rebuild we will recover and the united states of america
will emerge stronger than before
the weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this
nation the answers to our problems don't lie beyond our reach they
exist in our laboratories and universities in our fields and our
factories in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of
the hardest working people on earth those qualities that have made
america the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history
we still possess in ample measure what is required now is for this
country to pull together confront boldly the challenges we face and
take responsibility for our future once more
now if we're honest with ourselves we'll admit that for too long we
have not always met these responsibilities as a government or as a
people i say this not to lay blame or look backwards but because it
is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we'll be
able to lift ourselves out of this predicament
the fact is our economy did not fall into decline overnight nor did
all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the
stock market sank we have known for decades that our survival depends
on finding new sources of energy yet we import more oil today than
ever before the cost of health care eats up more and more of our
savings each year yet we keep delaying reform our children will
compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do
not prepare them for and though all these challenges went unsolved
we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt both as
individuals and through our government than ever before
in other words we have lived through an era where too often
short term gains were prized over long term prosperity where we
failed to look beyond the next payment the next quarter or the next
election a surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy
instead of an opportunity to invest in our future regulations were
gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy
market people bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks
and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway and all the while
critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other
time on some other day
well that day of reckoning has arrived and the time to take charge of
our future is here
now is the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this
economy but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity now is
the time to jumpstart job creation re start lending and invest in
areas like energy health care and education that will grow our
economy even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down that
is what my economic agenda is designed to do and that's what i'd like
to talk to you about tonight
it's an agenda that begins with jobs
as soon as i took office i asked this congress to send me a recovery
plan by president's day that would put people back to work and put
money in their pockets not because i believe in bigger government i
don't not because i'm not mindful of the massive debt we've inherited
i am i called for action because the failure to do so would have
cost more jobs and caused more hardships in fact a failure to act
would have worsened our long term deficit by assuring weak economic
growth for years that's why i pushed for quick action and tonight i
am grateful that this congress delivered and pleased to say that the
american recovery and reinvestment act is now law
over the next two years this plan will save or create 3 million
jobs more than 90% of these jobs will be in the private sector jobs
rebuilding our roads and bridges constructing wind turbines and solar
panels laying broadband and expanding mass transit
because of this plan there are teachers who can now keep their jobs
and educate our kids health care professionals can continue caring
for our sick there are 57 police officers who are still on the
streets of minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs
their department was about to make
because of this plan 95% of the working households in america will
receive a tax cut a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks
beginning on april 1st
because of this plan families who are struggling to pay tuition costs
will receive a $200 tax credit for all four years of college and
americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to
receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care
coverage to help them weather this storm
i know there are some in this chamber and watching at home who are
skeptical of whether this plan will work i understand that
skepticism here in washington we've all seen how quickly good
intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending and
with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it
right
that is why i have asked vice president biden to lead a tough
unprecedented oversight effort because nobody messes with joe i
have told each member of my cabinet as well as mayors and governors
across the country that they will be held accountable by me and the
american people for every dollar they spend i have appointed a proven
and aggressive inspector general to ferret out any and all cases of
waste and fraud and we have created a new website called recovery gov
so that every american can find out how and where their money is being
spent
so the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our
economy back on track but it is just the first step because even if
we manage this plan flawlessly there will be no real recovery unless
we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial
system
i want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight because
every american should know that it directly affects you and your
family's well being you should also know that the money you've
deposited in banks across the country is safe your insurance is
secure and you can rely on the continued operation of our financial
system that is not the source of concern
the concern is that if we do not re start lending in this country our
recovery will be choked off before it even begins
you see the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy the
ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything
from a home to a car to a college education how stores stock their
shelves farms buy equipment and businesses make payroll
but credit has stopped flowing the way it should too many bad loans
from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many
banks with so much debt and so little confidence these banks are now
fearful of lending out any more money to households to businesses or
to each other when there is no lending families can't afford to buy
homes or cars so businesses are forced to make layoffs our economy
suffers even more and credit dries up even further
that is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to
break this destructive cycle restore confidence and re start
lending
we will do so in several ways first we are creating a new lending
fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto
loans college loans and small business loans to the consumers and
entrepreneurs who keep this economy running
second we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible
families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments
and re finance their mortgages it's a plan that won't help
speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he
could never hope to afford but it will help millions of americans who
are struggling with declining home values americans who will now be
able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has
already helped bring about in fact the average family who
re finances today can save nearly $2000 per year on their mortgage
third we will act with the full force of the federal government to
ensure that the major banks that americans depend on have enough
confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times and
when we learn that a major bank has serious problems we will hold
accountable those responsible force the necessary adjustments
provide the support to clean up their balance sheets and assure the
continuity of a strong viable institution that can serve our people
and our economy
i understand that on any given day wall street may be more comforted
by an approach that gives banks bailouts with no strings attached and
that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions but such
an approach won't solve the problem and our goal is to quicken the
day when we re start lending to the american people and american
business and end this crisis once and for all
i intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they
receive and this time they will have to clearly demonstrate how
taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the american
taxpayer this time ceos won't be able to use taxpayer money to pad
their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private
jet those days are over
still this plan will require significant resources from the federal
government and yes probably more than we've already set aside but
while the cost of action will be great i can assure you that the cost
of inaction will be far greater for it could result in an economy
that sputters along for not months or years but perhaps a
decade that would be worse for our deficit worse for business worse
for you and worse for the next generation and i refuse to let that
happen
i understand that when the last administration asked this congress to
provide assistance for struggling banks democrats and republicans
alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and results that
followed so were the american taxpayers so was i
so i know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now
especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad
decisions i promise you i get it
but i also know that in a time of crisis we cannot afford to govern
out of anger or yield to the politics of the moment my job our job
is to solve the problem our job is to govern with a sense of
responsibility i will not spend a single penny for the purpose of
rewarding a single wall street executive but i will do whatever it
takes to help the small business that can't pay its workers or the
family that has saved and still can't get a mortgage
that's what this is about it's not about helping banks it's about
helping people because when credit is available again that young
family can finally buy a new home and then some company will hire
workers to build it and then those workers will have money to spend
and if they can get a loan too maybe they'll finally buy that car or
open their own business investors will return to the market and
american families will see their retirement secured once more slowly
but surely confidence will return and our economy will recover
so i ask this congress to join me in doing whatever proves
necessary because we cannot consign our nation to an open ended
recession and to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens
again i ask congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally
reform our outdated regulatory system it is time to put in place
tough new common sense rules of the road so that our financial market
rewards drive and innovation and punishes short cuts and abuse
the recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate
steps we're taking to revive our economy in the short term but the
only way to fully restore america's economic strength is to make the
long term investments that will lead to new jobs new industries and
a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world the only way
this century will be another american century is if we confront at
last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health
care the schools that aren't preparing our children and the mountain
of debt they stand to inherit that is our responsibility
in the next few days i will submit a budget to congress so often we
have come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or
laundry lists of programs i see this document differently i see it
as a vision for america as a blueprint for our future
my budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every
issue it reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited a
trillion dollar deficit a financial crisis and a costly recession
given these realities everyone in this chamber democrats and
republicans will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which
there are no dollars and that includes me
but that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long term
challenges i reject the view that says our problems will simply take
care of themselves that says government has no role in laying the
foundation for our common prosperity
for history tells a different story history reminds us that at every
moment of economic upheaval and transformation this nation has
responded with bold action and big ideas in the midst of civil war
we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred
commerce and industry from the turmoil of the industrial revolution
came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a
new age in the wake of war and depression the gi bill sent a
generation to college and created the largest middle class in
history and a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of
highways an american on the moon and an explosion of technology that
still shapes our world
in each case government didn't supplant private enterprise it
catalyzed private enterprise it created the conditions for thousands
of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive
we are a nation that has seen promise amid peril and claimed
opportunity from ordeal now we must be that nation again that is
why even as it cuts back on the programs we don't need the budget i
submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to
our economic future energy health care and education
it begins with energy
we know the country that harnesses the power of clean renewable
energy will lead the 21st century and yet it is china that has
launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy
efficient we invented solar technology but we've fallen behind
countries like germany and japan in producing it new plug in hybrids
roll off our assembly lines but they will run on batteries made in
korea
well i do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of
tomorrow take root beyond our borders and i know you don't
either it is time for america to lead again
thanks to our recovery plan we will double this nation's supply of
renewable energy in the next three years we have also made the
largest investment in basic research funding in american history an
investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy but
breakthroughs in medicine science and technology
we will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry
new energy to cities and towns across this country and we will put
americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so
that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills
but to truly transform our economy protect our security and save our
planet from the ravages of climate change we need to ultimately make
clean renewable energy the profitable kind of energy so i ask this
congress to send me legislation that places a market based cap on
carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in
america and to support that innovation we will invest fifteen
billion dollars a year to develop technologies like wind power and
solar power advanced biofuels clean coal and more fuel efficient
cars and trucks built right here in america
as for our auto industry everyone recognizes that years of bad
decision making and a global recession have pushed our automakers to
the brink we should not and will not protect them from their own
bad practices but we are committed to the goal of a re tooled
re imagined auto industry that can compete and win millions of jobs
depend on it scores of communities depend on it and i believe the
nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it
none of this will come without cost nor will it be easy but this is
america we don't do what's easy we do what is necessary to move this
country forward
for that same reason we must also address the crushing cost of health
care
this is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in america every thirty
seconds by the end of the year it could cause 1 million americans
to lose their homes in the last eight years premiums have grown four
times faster than wages and in each of these years one million more
americans have lost their health insurance it is one of the major
reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship
jobs overseas and it's one of the largest and fastest growing parts
of our budget
given these facts we can no longer afford to put health care reform
on hold
already we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform
in the last thirty days than we have in the last decade when it was
days old this congress passed a law to provide and protect health
insurance for eleven million american children whose parents work
full time our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records
and new technology that will reduce errors bring down costs ensure
privacy and save lives it will launch a new effort to conquer a
disease that has touched the life of nearly every american by seeking
a cure for cancer in our time and it makes the largest investment
ever in preventive care because that is one of the best ways to keep
our people healthy and our costs under control
this budget builds on these reforms it includes an historic
commitment to comprehensive health care reform a down payment on the
principle that we must have quality affordable health care for every
american it's a commitment that's paid for in part by efficiencies in
our system that are long overdue and it's a step we must take if we
hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come
now there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to
achieve reform and that is why i'm bringing together businesses and
workers doctors and health care providers democrats and republicans
to begin work on this issue next week
i suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process it will be
hard but i also know that nearly a century after teddy roosevelt
first called for reform the cost of our health care has weighed down
our economy and the conscience of our nation long enough so let there
be no doubt health care reform cannot wait it must not wait and it
will not wait another year
the third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the
promise of education in america
in a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your
knowledge a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity
it is a pre requisite
right now three quarters of the fastest growing occupations require
more than a high school diploma and yet just over half of our
citizens have that level of education we have one of the highest high
school dropout rates of any industrialized nation and half of the
students who begin college never finish
this is a prescription for economic decline because we know the
countries that out teach us today will out compete us tomorrow that
is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every
child has access to a complete and competitive education from the
day they are born to the day they begin a career
already we have made an historic investment in education through the
economic recovery plan we have dramatically expanded early childhood
education and will continue to improve its quality because we know
that the most formative learning comes in those first years of
life we have made college affordable for nearly seven million more
students and we have provided the resources necessary to prevent
painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children's
progress
but we know that our schools don't just need more resources they need
more reform that is why this budget creates new incentives for
teacher performance pathways for advancement and rewards for
success we'll invest in innovative programs that are already helping
schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps and we will
expand our commitment to charter schools
it is our responsibility as lawmakers and educators to make this
system work but it is the responsibility of every citizen to
participate in it and so tonight i ask every american to commit to
at least one year or more of higher education or career training this
can be community college or a four year school vocational training or
an apprenticeship but whatever the training may be every american
will need to get more than a high school diploma and dropping out of
high school is no longer an option it's not just quitting on
yourself it's quitting on your country and this country needs and
values the talents of every american that is why we will provide the
support necessary for you to complete college and meet a new goal by
2020, america will once again have the highest proportion of college
graduates in the world
i know that the price of tuition is higher than ever which is why if
you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your
community or serve your country we will make sure that you can afford
a higher education and to encourage a renewed spirit of national
service for this and future generations i ask this congress to send
me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of senator orrin
hatch as well as an american who has never stopped asking what he can
do for his country senator edward kennedy
these education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our
children but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them in the
end there is no program or policy that can substitute for a mother or
father who will attend those parent/teacher conferences or help with
homework after dinner or turn off the tv put away the video games
and read to their child i speak to you not just as a president but
as a father when i say that responsibility for our children's
education must begin at home
there is of course another responsibility we have to our
children and that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass
on to them a debt they cannot pay with the deficit we inherited the
cost of the crisis we face and the long term challenges we must meet
it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy
recovers we do what it takes to bring this deficit down
i'm proud that we passed the recovery plan free of earmarks and i
want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend
reflects only our most important national priorities
yesterday i held a fiscal summit where i pledged to cut the deficit
in half by the end of my first term in office my administration has
also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to
eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs as you can imagine this
is a process that will take some time but we're starting with the
biggest lines we have already identified two trillion dollars in
savings over the next decade
in this budget we will end education programs that don't work and end
direct payments to large agribusinesses that don't need them we'll
eliminate the no bid contracts that have wasted billions in iraq and
reform our defense budget so that we're not paying for cold war era
weapons systems we don't use we will root out the waste fraud and
abuse in our medicare program that doesn't make our seniors any
healthier and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our
tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship
our jobs overseas
in order to save our children from a future of debt we will also end
the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2% of americans but let me
perfectly clear because i know you'll hear the same old claims that
rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the
american people if your family earns less than $25000 a year you
will not see your taxes increased a single dime i repeat not one
single dime in fact the recovery plan provides a tax cut that's
right a tax cut for 95% of working families and these checks are
on the way
to preserve our long term fiscal health we must also address the
growing costs in medicare and social security comprehensive health
care reform is the best way to strengthen medicare for years to
come and we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for
social security while creating tax free universal savings accounts
for all americans
finally because we're also suffering from a deficit of trust i am
committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our
budget that is why this budget looks ahead ten years and accounts for
spending that was left out under the old rules and for the first
time that includes the full cost of fighting in iraq and
afghanistan for seven years we have been a nation at war no longer
will we hide its price
we are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars and i will
soon announce a way forward in iraq that leaves iraq to its people and
responsibly ends this war
and with our friends and allies we will forge a new and comprehensive
strategy for afghanistan and pakistan to defeat al qaeda and combat
extremism because i will not allow terrorists to plot against the
american people from safe havens half a world away
as we meet here tonight our men and women in uniform stand watch
abroad and more are readying to deploy to each and every one of them
and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence
americans are united in sending one message we honor your service we
are inspired by your sacrifice and you have our unyielding
support to relieve the strain on our forces my budget increases the
number of our soldiers and marines and to keep our sacred trust with
those who serve we will raise their pay and give our veterans the
expanded health care and benefits that they have earned
to overcome extremism we must also be vigilant in upholding the
values our troops defend because there is no force in the world more
powerful than the example of america that is why i have ordered the
closing of the detention center at guantanamo bay and will seek swift
and certain justice for captured terrorists because living our
values doesn't make us weaker it makes us safer and it makes us
stronger and that is why i can stand here tonight and say without
exception or equivocation that the united states of america does not
torture
in words and deeds we are showing the world that a new era of
engagement has begun for we know that america cannot meet the threats
of this century alone but the world cannot meet them without
america we cannot shun the negotiating table nor ignore the foes or
forces that could do us harm we are instead called to move forward
with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand
to seek progress toward a secure and lasting peace between israel and
her neighbors we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort to
meet the challenges of the 21st century from terrorism to nuclear
proliferation from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing
poverty we will strengthen old alliances forge new ones and use
all elements of our national power
and to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope we are
working with the nations of the g 0 to restore confidence in our
financial system avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism
and spur demand for american goods in markets across the globe for
the world depends on us to have a strong economy just as our economy
depends on the strength of the world's
as we stand at this crossroads of history the eyes of all people in
all nations are once again upon us watching to see what we do with
this moment waiting for us to lead
those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in
extraordinary times it is a tremendous burden but also a great
privilege one that has been entrusted to few generations of
americans for in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for
good or for ill
i know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth to become cynical
and doubtful consumed with the petty and the trivial
but in my life i have also learned that hope is found in unlikely
places that inspiration often comes not from those with the most
power or celebrity but from the dreams and aspirations of americans
who are anything but ordinary
i think about leonard abess the bank president from miami who
reportedly cashed out of his company took a $60 million bonus and
gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him plus another 72 who
used to work for him he didn't tell anyone but when the local
newspaper found out he simply said i knew some of these people
since i was 7 years old i didn't feel right getting the money
myself
i think about greensburg kansas a town that was completely destroyed
by a tornado but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global
example of how clean energy can power an entire community how it can
bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble
once lay the tragedy was terrible said one of the men who helped
them rebuild but the folks here know that it also provided an
incredible opportunity
and i think about ty'sheoma bethea the young girl from that school i
visited in dillon south carolina a place where the ceilings leak
the paint peels off the walls and they have to stop teaching six
times a day because the train barrels by their classroom she has been
told that her school is hopeless but the other day after class she
went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting
in this room she even asked her principal for the money to buy a
stamp the letter asks us for help and says we are just students
trying to become lawyers doctors congressmen like yourself and one
day president so we can make a change to not just the state of south
carolina but also the world we are not quitters
we are not quitters
these words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of
the people who sent us here they tell us that even in the most trying
times amid the most difficult circumstances there is a generosity a
resilience a decency and a determination that perseveres a
willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity
their resolve must be our inspiration their concerns must be our
cause and we must show them and all our people that we are equal to
the task before us
i know that we haven't agreed on every issue thus far and there are
surely times in the future when we will part ways but i also know
that every american who is sitting here tonight loves this country and
wants it to succeed that must be the starting point for every debate
we have in the coming months and where we return after those debates
are done that is the foundation on which the american people expect
us to build common ground
and if we do if we come together and lift this nation from the
depths of this crisis if we put our people back to work and restart
the engine of our prosperity if we confront without fear the
challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an america
that does not quit then someday years from now our children can tell
their children that this was the time when we performed in the words
that are carved into this very chamber something worthy to be
remembered thank you god bless you and may god bless the united
states of america
madame speaker vice president biden members of congress distinguished guests
and fellow americans
our constitution declares that from time to time the president shall give to congress
information about the state of our union for two hundred and twenty years our
leaders have fulfilled this duty they have done so during periods of prosperity and
tranquility and they have done so in the midst of war and depression at moments of
great strife and great struggle
itâ€™s tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was
inevitable that america was always destined to succeed but when the union was
turned back at bull run and the allies first landed at omaha beach victory was very
much in doubt when the market crashed on black tuesday and civil rights marchers
were beaten on bloody sunday the future was anything but certain these were times
that tested the courage of our convictions and the strength of our union and despite
all our divisions and disagreements our hesitations and our fears america prevailed
because we chose to move forward as one nation and one people
again we are tested and again we must answer historyâ€™s call
one year ago i took office amid two wars an economy rocked by severe recession a
financial system on the verge of collapse and a government deeply in debt experts
from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act we might face a second
depression so we acted immediately and aggressively and one year later the worst
of the storm has passed
but the devastation remains one in ten americans still cannot find work many
businesses have shuttered home values have declined small towns and rural
communities have been hit especially hard for those who had already known poverty
life has become that much harder
this recession has also compounded the burdens that americaâ€™s families have been
dealing with for decades the burden of working harder and longer for less of being
unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college
so i know the anxieties that are out there right now theyâ€™re not new these struggles
are the reason i ran for president these struggles are what iâ€™ve witnessed for years in
places like elkhart indiana and galesburg illinois i hear about them in the letters that
i read each night the toughest to read are those written by children asking why they
have to move from their home or when their mom or dad will be able to go back to
work
for these americans and so many others change has not come fast enough some are
frustrated some are angry they donâ€™t understand why it seems like bad behavior on
wall street is rewarded but hard work on main street isnâ€™t or why washington has
been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems they are tired of the
partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness they know we canâ€™t afford it not
now
so we face big and difficult challenges and what the american people hope what
they deserve is for all of us democrats and republicans to work through our
differences to overcome the numbing weight of our politics for while the people who
sent us here have different backgrounds different stories and different beliefs the
anxieties they face are the same the aspirations they hold are shared a job that pays
the bills a chance to get ahead most of all the ability to give their children a better
life
you know what else they share they share a stubborn resilience in the face of
adversity after one of the most difficult years in our history they remain busy
building cars and teaching kids starting businesses and going back to school theyâ€™re
coaching little league and helping their neighbors as one woman wrote me â€œwe are
strained but hopeful struggling but encouraged
it is because of this spirit this great decency and great strength that i have never
been more hopeful about americaâ€™s future than i am tonight despite our hardships
our union is strong we do not give up we do not quit we do not allow fear or
division to break our spirit in this new decade itâ€™s time the american people get a
government that matches their decency that embodies their strength
and tonight iâ€™d like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise
it begins with our economy
our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped
cause this crisis it was not easy to do and if thereâ€™s one thing that has unified
democrats and republicans itâ€™s that we all hated the bank bailout i hated it you
hated it it was about as popular as a root canal
but when i ran for president i promised i wouldnâ€™t just do what was popular i would
do what was necessary and if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system
unemployment might be double what it is today more businesses would certainly
have closed more homes would have surely been lost
so i supported the last administrationâ€™s efforts to create the financial rescue program
and when we took the program over we made it more transparent and accountable
as a result the markets are now stabilized and we have recovered most of the money
we spent on the banks
to recover the rest i have proposed a fee on the biggest banks i know wall street isnâ€™t
keen on this idea but if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again they can
afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need
as we stabilized the financial system we also took steps to get our economy growing
again save as many jobs as possible and help americans who had become
unemployed
thatâ€™s why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million
americans made health insurance 65% cheaper for families who get their coverage
through cobra and passed 25 different tax cuts
let me repeat we cut taxes we cut taxes for 95% of working families we cut taxes for
small businesses we cut taxes for first time homebuyers we cut taxes for parents
trying to care for their children we cut taxes for 8 million americans paying for
college as a result millions of americans had more to spend on gas and food and
other necessities all of which helped businesses keep more workers and we havenâ€™t
raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person not a single dime
because of the steps we took there are about two million americans working right now
who would otherwise be unemployed 20000 work in construction and clean energy
30000 are teachers and other education workers tens of thousands are cops
firefighters correctional officers and first responders and we are on track to add
another one and a half million jobs to this total by the end of the year
the plan that has made all of this possible from the tax cuts to the jobs is the recovery
act thatâ€™s right the recovery act also known as the stimulus bill economists on
the left and the right say that this bill has helped saved jobs and avert disaster but you
donâ€™t have to take their word for it
talk to the small business in phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the
recovery act
talk to the window manufacturer in philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical
about the recovery act until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the
business it created
talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last
week of school that because of the recovery act she wouldnâ€™t be laid off after all
there are stories like this all across america and after two years of recession the
economy is growing again retirement funds have started to gain back some of their
value businesses are beginning to invest again and slowly some are starting to hire
again
but i realize that for every success story there are other stories of men and women who
wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from
who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response that is why jobs
must be our number one focus in 2010, and that is why i am calling for a new jobs bill
tonight
now the true engine of job creation in this country will always be americaâ€™s
businesses but government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to
expand and hire more workers
we should start where most new jobs do in small businesses companies that begin
when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides its time she
became her own boss
through sheer grit and determination these companies have weathered the recession
and are ready to grow but when you talk to small business owners in places like
allentown pennsylvania or elyria ohio you find out that even though banks on wall
street are lending again they are mostly lending to bigger companies but financing
remains difficult for small business owners across the country
so tonight iâ€™m proposing that we take $30 billion of the money wall street banks have
repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to
stay afloat i am also proposing a new small business tax credit one that will go to
over one million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages while weâ€™re at
it letâ€™s also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment and provide a
tax incentive for all businesses large and small to invest in new plants and equipment
next we can put americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow
from the first railroads to the interstate highway system our nation has always been
built to compete thereâ€™s no reason europe or china should have the fastest trains or
the new factories that manufacture clean energy products
tomorrow iâ€™ll visit tampa florida where workers will soon break ground on a new
high speed railroad funded by the recovery act there are projects like that all across
this country that will create jobs and help our nation move goods services and
information we should put more americans to work building clean energy facilities
and give rebates to americans who make their homes more energy efficient which
supports clean energy jobs and to encourage these and other businesses to stay within
our borders itâ€™s time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs
overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs in the united states of
america
the house has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps as the first order of
business this year i urge the senate to do the same people are out of work they are
hurting they need our help and i want a jobs bill on my desk without delay
but the truth is these steps still wonâ€™t make up for the seven million jobs weâ€™ve lost
over the last two years the only way to move to full employment is to lay a new
foundation for long term economic growth and finally address the problems that
americaâ€™s families have confronted for years
we cannot afford another so called economic â€œexpansionâ€ like the one from last decade
what some call the â€œlost decadeâ€ where jobs grew more slowly than during any
prior expansion where the income of the average american household declined while
the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs where prosperity was built on a
housing bubble and financial speculation
from the day i took office i have been told that addressing our larger challenges is too
ambitious that such efforts would be too contentious that our political system is too
gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for awhile
for those who make these claims i have one simple question
how long should we wait how long should america put its future on hold
you see washington has been telling us to wait for decades even as the problems have
grown worse meanwhile chinaâ€™s not waiting to revamp its economy germanyâ€™s not
waiting indiaâ€™s not waiting these nations arenâ€™t standing still these nations arenâ€™t
playing for second place theyâ€™re putting more emphasis on math and science theyâ€™re
rebuilding their infrastructure they are making serious investments in clean energy
because they want those jobs
well i do not accept second place for the united states of america as hard as it may
be as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may be itâ€™s time to get serious
about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth
one place to start is serious financial reform look i am not interested in punishing
banks iâ€™m interested in protecting our economy a strong healthy financial market
makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs it channels the
savings of families into investments that raise incomes but that can only happen if we
guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy
we need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the information they
need to make financial decisions we canâ€™t allow financial institutions including those
that take your deposits to take risks that threaten the whole economy
the house has already passed financial reform with many of these changes and the
lobbyists are already trying to kill it well we cannot let them win this fight and if the
bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform i will send it back
next we need to encourage american innovation last year we made the largest
investment in basic research funding in history an investment that could lead to the
worldâ€™s cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones
untouched and no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy you can see the
results of last yearâ€™s investment in clean energy in the north carolina company that
will create 1200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries or in the
california business that will put 100 people to work making solar panels
but to create more of these clean energy jobs we need more production more
efficiency more incentives that means building a new generation of safe clean
nuclear power plants in this country it means making tough decisions about opening
new offshore areas for oil and gas development it means continued investment in
advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies and yes it means passing a
comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean
energy the profitable kind of energy in america
i am grateful to the house for passing such a bill last year this year i am eager to help
advance the bipartisan effort in the senate i know there have been questions about
whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy and i know that there are
those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change but
even if you doubt the evidence providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean
energy are the right thing to do for our future because the nation that leads the clean
energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy and america must
be that nation
third we need to export more of our goods because the more products we make and
sell to other countries the more jobs we support right here in america so tonight we
set a new goal we will double our exports over the next five years an increase that
will support two million jobs in america to help meet this goal weâ€™re launching a
national export initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their
exports and reform export controls consistent with national security
we have to seek new markets aggressively just as our competitors are if america sits
on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals we will lose the chance to create
jobs on our shores but realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements
so our trading partners play by the rules and thatâ€™s why we will continue to shape a
doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade
relations in asia and with key partners like south korea panama and colombia
fourth we need to invest in the skills and education of our people
this year we have broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a
national competition to improve our schools the idea here is simple instead of
rewarding failure we only reward success instead of funding the status quo we only
invest in reform reform that raises student achievement inspires students to excel in
math and science and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many
young americans from rural communities to inner cities in the 21st century one of the
best anti poverty programs is a world class education in this country the success of
our children cannot depend more on where they live than their potential
when we renew the elementary and secondary education act we will work with
congress to expand these reforms to all fifty states still in this economy a high school
diploma no longer guarantees a good job i urge the senate to follow the house and
pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges which are a career pathway to
the children of so many working families to make college more affordable this bill
will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans
instead letâ€™s take that money and give families a $1000 tax credit for four years of
college and increase pell grants and letâ€™s tell another one million students that when
they graduate they will be required to pay only ten percent of their income on student
loans and all of their debt will be forgiven after twenty years and forgiven after ten
years if they choose a career in public service because in the united states of america
no one should go broke because they chose to go to college and itâ€™s time for colleges
and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs because they too have a
responsibility to help solve this problem
now the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class
thatâ€™s why last year i asked vice president biden to chair a task force on middle class
families thatâ€™s why weâ€™re nearly doubling the child care tax credit and making it
easier to save for retirement by giving every worker access to a retirement account and
expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg thatâ€™s why weâ€™re working to lift
the value of a familyâ€™s single largest investment their home the steps we took last
year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of americans to take out
new loans and save an average of $100 on mortgage payments this year we will step
up re financing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages and it
is precisely to relieve the burden on middle class families that we still need health
insurance reform
now letâ€™s be clear i did not choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory
under my belt and by now it should be fairly obvious that i didnâ€™t take on health care
because it was good politics
i took on health care because of the stories iâ€™ve heard from americans with pre existing
conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage patients whoâ€™ve been denied
coverage and families even those with insurance who are just one illness away from
financial ruin
after nearly a century of trying we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the
lives of so many americans the approach weâ€™ve taken would protect every american
from the worst practices of the insurance industry it would give small businesses and
uninsured americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive
market it would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care and by the
way i want to acknowledge our first lady michelle obama who this year is creating a
national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make our kids
healthier
our approach would preserve the right of americans who have insurance to keep their
doctor and their plan it would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and
businesses and according to the congressional budget office the independent
organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for congress our
approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two
decades
still this is a complex issue and the longer it was debated the more skeptical people
became i take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the american
people and i know that with all the lobbying and horse trading this process left most
americans wondering whatâ€™s in it for them
but i also know this problem is not going away by the time iâ€™m finished speaking
tonight more americans will have lost their health insurance millions will lose it this
year our deficit will grow premiums will go up patients will be denied the care they
need small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether i will not walk
away from these americans and neither should the people in this chamber
as temperatures cool i want everyone to take another look at the plan weâ€™ve proposed
thereâ€™s a reason why many doctors nurses and health care experts who know our
system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo but if
anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums bring
down the deficit cover the uninsured strengthen medicare for seniors and stop
insurance company abuses let me know hereâ€™s what i ask of congress though do
not walk away from reform not now not when we are so close let us find a way to
come together and finish the job for the american people
now even as health care reform would reduce our deficit itâ€™s not enough to dig us out
of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves itâ€™s a challenge that makes all
others that much harder to solve and one thatâ€™s been subject to a lot of political
posturing
so let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight at
the beginning of the last decade america had a budget surplus of over $200 billion by
the time i took office we had a one year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits
of $8 trillion over the next decade most of this was the result of not paying for two
wars two tax cuts and an expensive prescription drug program on top of that the
effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget that was before i walked in
the door
now if we had taken office in ordinary times i would have liked nothing more than to
start bringing down the deficit but we took office amid a crisis and our efforts to
prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt
i am absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do but families across the
country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions the federal government
should do the same so tonight iâ€™m proposing specific steps to pay for the $1 trillion
that it took to rescue the economy last year
starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years
spending related to our national security medicare medicaid and social security will
not be affected but all other discretionary government programs will like any cash
strapped family we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice
what we donâ€™t and if i have to enforce this discipline by veto i will
we will continue to go through the budget line by line to eliminate programs that we
canâ€™t afford and donâ€™t work weâ€™ve already identified $20 billion in savings for next
year to help working families we will extend our middle class tax cuts but at a time
of record deficits we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies investment fund
managers and those making over $25000 a year we just canâ€™t afford it
now even after paying for what we spent on my watch we will still face the massive
deficit we had when i took office more importantly the cost of medicare medicaid
and social security will continue to skyrocket thatâ€™s why iâ€™ve called for a bipartisan
fiscal commission modeled on a proposal by republican judd gregg and democrat
kent conrad this canâ€™t be one of those washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we
solved a problem the commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a
certain deadline yesterday the senate blocked a bill that would have created this
commission so i will issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward because
i refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of americans and when the
vote comes tomorrow the senate should restore the pay as you go law that was a big
reason why we had record surpluses in the 1990s
i know that some in my own party will argue that we cannot address the deficit or
freeze government spending when so many are still hurting i agree which is why this
freeze will not take effect until next year when the economy is stronger but
understand if we do not take meaningful steps to rein in our debt it could damage
our markets increase the cost of borrowing and jeopardize our recovery all of which
could have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes
from some on the right i expect weâ€™ll hear a different argument that if we just make
fewer investments in our people extend tax cuts for wealthier americans eliminate
more regulations and maintain the status quo on health care our deficits will go away
the problem is thatâ€™s what we did for eight years thatâ€™s what helped lead us into this
crisis itâ€™s what helped lead to these deficits and we cannot do it again
rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated washington for decades
itâ€™s time to try something new letâ€™s invest in our people without leaving them a
mountain of debt letâ€™s meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here letâ€™s
try common sense
to do that we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now
we face a deficit of trust deep and corrosive doubts about how washington works
that have been growing for years to close that credibility gap we must take action on
both ends of pennsylvania avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists to do our
work openly and to give our people the government they deserve
thatâ€™s what i came to washington to do thatâ€™s why for the first time in history my
administration posts our white house visitors online and thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve excluded
lobbyists from policy making jobs or seats on federal boards and commissions
but we canâ€™t stop there itâ€™s time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make
on behalf of a client with my administration or congress and itâ€™s time to put strict
limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office last week
the supreme court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests
including foreign corporations to spend without limit in our elections well i donâ€™t
think american elections should be bankrolled by americaâ€™s most powerful interests or
worse by foreign entities they should be decided by the american people and thatâ€™s
why iâ€™m urging democrats and republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong
iâ€™m also calling on congress to continue down the path of earmark reform you have
trimmed some of this spending and embraced some meaningful change but restoring
the public trust demands more for example some members of congress post some
earmark requests online tonight iâ€™m calling on congress to publish all earmark
requests on a single website before thereâ€™s a vote so that the american people can see
how their money is being spent
of course none of these reforms will even happen if we donâ€™t also reform how we work
with one another
now i am not naÃ¯ve i never thought the mere fact of my election would usher in
peace harmony and some post partisan era i knew that both parties have fed
divisions that are deeply entrenched and on some issues there are simply
philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways these disagreements
about the role of government in our lives about our national priorities and our national
security have been taking place for over two hundred years they are the very essence
of our democracy
but what frustrates the american people is a washington where every day is election
day we cannot wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get
the most embarrassing headlines about their opponent a belief that if you lose i win
neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can the
confirmation of well qualified public servants should not be held hostage to the pet
projects or grudges of a few individual senators washington may think that saying
anything about the other side no matter how false is just part of the game but it is
precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the american people
worse yet it is sowing further division among our citizens and further distrust in our
government
so no i will not give up on changing the tone of our politics i know itâ€™s an election
year and after last week it is clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than
usual but we still need to govern to democrats i would remind you that we still
have the largest majority in decades and the people expect us to solve some problems
not run for the hills and if the republican leadership is going to insist that sixty votes
in the senate are required to do any business at all in this town then the responsibility
to govern is now yours as well just saying no to everything may be good short term
politics but itâ€™s not leadership we were sent here to serve our citizens not our
ambitions so letâ€™s show the american people that we can do it together this week iâ€™ll
be addressing a meeting of the house republicans and i would like to begin monthly
meetings with both the democratic and republican leadership i know you canâ€™t wait
throughout our history no issue has united this country more than our security sadly
some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated we can argue all we want about
whoâ€™s to blame for this but i am not interested in re litigating the past i know that all
of us love this country all of us are committed to its defense so letâ€™s put aside the
schoolyard taunts about who is tough letâ€™s reject the false choice between protecting
our people and upholding our values letâ€™s leave behind the fear and division and do
what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future for america and
the world
that is the work we began last year since the day i took office we have renewed our
focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation we have made substantial investments
in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take american lives
we are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed christmas attack with better
airline security and swifter action on our intelligence we have prohibited torture and
strengthened partnerships from the pacific to south asia to the arabian peninsula
and in the last year hundreds of al qaedaâ€™s fighters and affiliates including many
senior leaders have been captured or killed far more than in 2008.
in afghanistan we are increasing our troops and training afghan security forces so
they can begin to take the lead in july of 2011, and our troops can begin to come home
we will reward good governance reduce corruption and support the rights of all
afghans men and women alike we are joined by allies and partners who have
increased their own commitment and who will come together tomorrow in london to
reaffirm our common purpose there will be difficult days ahead but i am confident
we will succeed
as we take the fight to al qaeda we are responsibly leaving iraq to its people as a
candidate i promised that i would end this war and that is what i am doing as
president we will have all of our combat troops out of iraq by the end of this august
we will support the iraqi government as they hold elections and continue to partner
with the iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity but make no mistake
this war is ending and all of our troops are coming home
tonight all of our men and women in uniform in iraq afghanistan and around the
world must know that they have our respect our gratitude and our full support and
just as they must have the resources they need in war we all have a responsibility to
support them when they come home that is why we made the largest increase in
investments for veterans in decades that is why we are building a 21st century va
and that is why michelle has joined with jill biden to forge a national commitment to
support military families
even as we prosecute two wars we are also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to
the american people the threat of nuclear weapons i have embraced the vision of
john f kennedy and ronald reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of
these weapons and seeks a world without them to reduce our stockpiles and
launchers while ensuring our deterrent the united states and russia are completing
negotiations on the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades and at
aprilâ€™s nuclear security summit we will bring forty four nations together behind a
clear goal securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years so
that they never fall into the hands of terrorists
these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations
that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of these weapons that is
why north korea now faces increased isolation and stronger sanctions sanctions that
are being vigorously enforced that is why the international community is more
united and the islamic republic of iran is more isolated and as iranâ€™s leaders continue
to ignore their obligations there should be no doubt they too will face growing
consequences
that is the leadership that we are providing engagement that advances the common
security and prosperity of all people we are working through the g 0 to sustain a
lasting global recovery we are working with muslim communities around the world to
promote science education and innovation we have gone from a bystander to a leader
in the fight against climate change we are helping developing countries to feed
themselves and continuing the fight against hiv/aids and we are launching a new
initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bio
terrorism or an infectious disease a plan that will counter threats at home and
strengthen public health abroad
as we have for over sixty years america takes these actions because our destiny is
connected to those beyond our shores but we also do it because it is right that is why
as we meet here tonight over 1000 americans are working with many nations to help
the people of haiti recover and rebuild that is why we stand with the girl who yearns
to go to school in afghanistan we support the human rights of the women marching
through the streets of iran and we advocate for the young man denied a job by
corruption in guinea for america must always stand on the side of freedom and
human dignity
abroad americaâ€™s greatest source of strength has always been our ideals the same is
true at home we find unity in our incredible diversity drawing on the promise
enshrined in our constitution the notion that we are all created equal that no matter
who you are or what you look like if you abide by the law you should be protected by
it that if you adhere to our common values you should be treated no different than
anyone else
we must continually renew this promise my administration has a civil rights
division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment
discrimination we finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by
hate this year i will work with congress and our military to finally repeal the law that
denies gay americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are
we are going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws so that women get equal
pay for an equal dayâ€™s work and we should continue the work of fixing our broken
immigration system to secure our borders enforce our laws and ensure that everyone
who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nations
in the end it is our ideals our values that built america values that allowed us to
forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe values that drive
our citizens still every day americans meet their responsibilities to their families and
their employers time and again they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to
their country they take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit these arenâ€™t
republican values or democratic values theyâ€™re living by business values or labor
values they are american values
unfortunately too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions
our corporations our media and yes our government still reflect these same values
each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work
that helps our country prosper but each time a ceo rewards himself for failure or a
banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain peopleâ€™s doubts grow each
time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this
country up we lose faith the more that tv pundits reduce serious debates into silly
arguments and big issues into sound bites our citizens turn away
no wonder thereâ€™s so much cynicism out there
no wonder thereâ€™s so much disappointment
i campaigned on the promise of change change we can believe in the slogan went
and right now i know there are many americans who arenâ€™t sure if they still believe
we can change or at least that i can deliver it
but remember this i never suggested that change would be easy or that i can do it
alone democracy in a nation of three hundred million people can be noisy and messy
and complicated and when you try to do big things and make big changes it stirs
passions and controversy thatâ€™s just how it is
those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid
telling hard truths we can do whatâ€™s necessary to keep our poll numbers high and get
through the next election instead of doing whatâ€™s best for the next generation
but i also know this if people had made that decision fifty years ago or one hundred
years ago or two hundred years ago we wouldnâ€™t be here tonight the only reason we
are is because generations of americans were unafraid to do what was hard to do what
was needed even when success was uncertain to do what it took to keep the dream of
this nation alive for their children and grandchildren
our administration has had some political setbacks this year and some of them were
deserved but i wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the
setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year and what keeps me
going what keeps me fighting is that despite all these setbacks that spirit of
determination and optimism that fundamental decency that has always been at the
core of the american people lives on
it lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company
â€œnone of us he said are willing to consider even slightly that we might fail
it lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the
pain of recession â€œwe are strong we are resilient we are american
it lives on in the 8- year old boy in louisiana who just sent me his allowance and asked
if i would give it to the people of haiti and it lives on in all the americans whoâ€™ve
dropped everything to go some place theyâ€™ve never been and pull people theyâ€™ve never
known from rubble prompting chants of â€œu s a u s a u s a when another life
was saved
the spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you its
people
we have finished a difficult year we have come through a difficult decade but a new
year has come a new decade stretches before us we donâ€™t quit i donâ€™t quit letâ€™s
seize this moment to start anew to carry the dream forward and to strengthen our
union once more
thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america
mr. speaker mr. vice president members of congress distinguished
guests and fellow americans
tonight i want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th congress as well as
your new speaker john boehner applause and as we mark this occasion weâ€™re also mindful
of the empty chair in this chamber and we pray for the health of our colleague and our friend
gabby giffords applause
itâ€™s no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last two years the
debates have been contentious we have fought fiercely for our beliefs and thatâ€™s a good thing
thatâ€™s what a robust democracy demands thatâ€™s what helps set us apart as a nation
but thereâ€™s a reason the tragedy in tucson gave us pause amid all the noise and passion and
rancor of our public debate tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come
from each of us is a part of something greater something more consequential than party or
political preference
we are part of the american family we believe that in a country where every race and faith and
point of view can be found we are still bound together as one people that we share common
hopes and a common creed that the dreams of a little girl in tucson are not so different than
those of our own children and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled
that too is what sets us apart as a nation applause
now by itself this simple recognition wonâ€™t usher in a new era of cooperation what comes of
this moment is up to us what comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can
sit together tonight but whether we can work together tomorrow applause
i believe we can and i believe we must thatâ€™s what the people who sent us here expect of us
with their votes theyâ€™ve determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between
parties new laws will only pass with support from democrats and republicans we will move
forward together or not at all for the challenges we face are bigger than party and bigger than
politics
at stake right now is not who wins the next election after all we just had an election at stake
is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country or somewhere else itâ€™s whether the
hard work and industry of our people is rewarded itâ€™s whether we sustain the leadership that has
made america not just a place on a map but the light to the world
we are poised for progress two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known the
stock market has come roaring back corporate profits are up the economy is growing again
but we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone we measure progress by the
success of our people by the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer by the
prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise
by the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children
thatâ€™s the project the american people want us to work on together applause
we did that in december thanks to the tax cuts we passed americansâ€™ paychecks are a little
bigger today every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this
year and these steps taken by democrats and republicans will grow the economy and add to
the more than one million private sector jobs created last year
but we have to do more these steps weâ€™ve taken over the last two years may have broken the
back of this recession but to win the future weâ€™ll need to take on challenges that have been
decades in the making
many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant
showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown you didnâ€™t always need a degree and
your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors if you worked hard chances are
youâ€™d have a job for life with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional
promotion maybe youâ€™d even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company
that world has changed and for many the change has been painful iâ€™ve seen it in the shuttered
windows of once booming factories and the vacant storefronts on once busy main streets iâ€™ve
heard it in the frustrations of americans whoâ€™ve seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs
disappear proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of
the game
theyâ€™re right the rules have changed in a single generation revolutions in technology have
transformed the way we live work and do business steel mills that once needed 100 workers
can now do the same work with 100. today just about any company can set up shop hire
workers and sell their products wherever thereâ€™s an internet connection
meanwhile nations like china and india realized that with some changes of their own they
could compete in this new world and so they started educating their children earlier and longer
with greater emphasis on math and science theyâ€™re investing in research and new technologies
just recently china became the home to the worldâ€™s largest private solar research facility and
the worldâ€™s fastest computer
so yes the world has changed the competition for jobs is real but this shouldnâ€™t discourage
us it should challenge us remember for all the hits weâ€™ve taken these last few years for all
the naysayers predicting our decline america still has the largest most prosperous economy in
the world applause no workers no workers are more productive than ours no country has
more successful companies or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs weâ€™re the
home to the worldâ€™s best colleges and universities where more students come to study than any
place on earth
whatâ€™s more we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea the idea that each of
us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny thatâ€™s why centuries of pioneers and
immigrants have risked everything to come here itâ€™s why our students donâ€™t just memorize
equations but answer questions like â€œwhat do you think of that idea what would you change
about the world what do you want to be when you grow up
the future is ours to win but to get there we canâ€™t just stand still as robert kennedy told us
â€œthe future is not a gift it is an achievement sustaining the american dream has never been
about standing pat it has required each generation to sacrifice and struggle and meet the
demands of a new age
and now itâ€™s our turn we know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time
we need to out innovate out educate and out build the rest of the world applause we have
to make america the best place on earth to do business we need to take responsibility for our
deficit and reform our government thatâ€™s how our people will prosper thatâ€™s how weâ€™ll win the
future applause and tonight iâ€™d like to talk about how we get there
the first step in winning the future is encouraging american innovation none of us can predict
with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from thirty
years ago we couldnâ€™t know that something called the internet would lead to an economic
revolution what we can do what america does better than anyone else is spark the
creativity and imagination of our people weâ€™re the nation that put cars in driveways and
computers in offices the nation of edison and the wright brothers of google and facebook in
america innovation doesnâ€™t just change our lives it is how we make our living applause
our free enterprise system is what drives innovation but because itâ€™s not always profitable for
companies to invest in basic research throughout our history our government has provided
cutting edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need thatâ€™s what planted the
seeds for the internet thatâ€™s what helped make possible things like computer chips and gps
just think of all the good jobs from manufacturing to retail that have come from these
breakthroughs
half a century ago when the soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called
sputnik we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon the science wasnâ€™t even there
yet nasa didnâ€™t exist but after investing in better research and education we didnâ€™t just
surpass the soviets we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions
of new jobs
this is our generationâ€™s sputnik moment two years ago i said that we needed to reach a level
of research and development we havenâ€™t seen since the height of the space race and in a few
weeks i will be sending a budget to congress that helps us meet that goal weâ€™ll invest in
biomedical research information technology and especially clean energy technology
applause an investment that will strengthen our security protect our planet and create
countless new jobs for our people
already weâ€™re seeing the promise of renewable energy robert and gary allen are brothers who
run a small michigan roofing company after september 11th they volunteered their best
roofers to help repair the pentagon but half of their factory went unused and the recession hit
them hard today with the help of a government loan that empty space is being used to
manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country in robertâ€™s words â€œwe
reinvented ourselves
thatâ€™s what americans have done for over 200 years reinvented ourselves and to spur on more
success stories like the allen brothers weâ€™ve begun to reinvent our energy policy weâ€™re not just
handing out money weâ€™re issuing a challenge weâ€™re telling americaâ€™s scientists and engineers
that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields and focus on the hardest problems in
clean energy weâ€™ll fund the apollo projects of our time
at the california institute of technology theyâ€™re developing a way to turn sunlight and water
into fuel for our cars at oak ridge national laboratory theyâ€™re using supercomputers to get a
lot more power out of our nuclear facilities with more research and incentives we can break our
dependence on oil with biofuels and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles
on the road by 2015. applause
we need to get behind this innovation and to help pay for it iâ€™m asking congress to eliminate
the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies applause i donâ€™t know if
i donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve noticed but theyâ€™re doing just fine on their own laughter so instead of
subsidizing yesterdayâ€™s energy letâ€™s invest in tomorrowâ€™s
now clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know
there will be a market for what theyâ€™re selling so tonight i challenge you to join me in setting a
new goal by 2035, 80 percent of americaâ€™s electricity will come from clean energy sources
applause
some folks want wind and solar others want nuclear clean coal and natural gas to meet this
goal we will need them all and i urge democrats and republicans to work together to make it
happen applause
maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to americaâ€™s success but if we
want to win the future if we want innovation to produce jobs in america and not overseas
then we also have to win the race to educate our kids
think about it over the next 10 years nearly half of all new jobs will require education that
goes beyond a high school education and yet as many as a quarter of our students arenâ€™t even
finishing high school the quality of our math and science education lags behind many other
nations america has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree and
so the question is whether all of us as citizens and as parents are willing to do whatâ€™s
necessary to give every child a chance to succeed
that responsibility begins not in our classrooms but in our homes and communities itâ€™s family
that first instills the love of learning in a child only parents can make sure the tv is turned off
and homework gets done we need to teach our kids that itâ€™s not just the winner of the super
bowl who deserves to be celebrated but the winner of the science fair applause we need to
teach them that success is not a function of fame or pr but of hard work and discipline
our schools share this responsibility when a child walks into a classroom it should be a place
of high expectations and high performance but too many schools donâ€™t meet this test thatâ€™s
why instead of just pouring money into a system thatâ€™s not working we launched a competition
called race to the top to all 50 states we said â€œif you show us the most innovative plans to
improve teacher quality and student achievement weâ€™ll show you the money
race to the top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation for less
than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year it has led over 40 states to raise their
standards for teaching and learning and these standards were developed by the way not by
washington but by republican and democratic governors throughout the country and race to
the top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace no child left behind with a
law thatâ€™s more flexible and focused on whatâ€™s best for our kids applause
you see we know whatâ€™s possible from our children when reform isnâ€™t just a top down mandate
but the work of local teachers and principals school boards and communities take a school like
bruce randolph in denver three years ago it was rated one of the worst schools in colorado
located on turf between two rival gangs but last may 97 percent of the seniors received their
diploma most will be the first in their families to go to college and after the first year of the
schoolâ€™s transformation the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student
said â€œthank you ms waters for showing that we are smart and we can make it applause
thatâ€™s what good schools can do and we want good schools all across the country
letâ€™s also remember that after parents the biggest impact on a childâ€™s success comes from the
man or woman at the front of the classroom in south korea teachers are known as â€œnation
builders here in america itâ€™s time we treated the people who educate our children with the
same level of respect applause we want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for
bad ones applause and over the next 10 years with so many baby boomers retiring from our
classrooms we want to prepare 10000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and
engineering and math applause
in fact to every young person listening tonight whoâ€™s contemplating their career choice if you
want to make a difference in the life of our nation if you want to make a difference in the life of
a child become a teacher your country needs you applause
of course the education race doesnâ€™t end with a high school diploma to compete higher
education must be within the reach of every american applause thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve ended the
unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks and used the savings to make college
affordable for millions of students applause and this year i ask congress to go further and
make permanent our tuition tax credit worth $1000 for four years of college itâ€™s the right
thing to do applause
because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in todayâ€™s fast changing
economy weâ€™re also revitalizing americaâ€™s community colleges last month i saw the promise
of these schools at forsyth tech in north carolina many of the students there used to work in
the surrounding factories that have since left town one mother of two a woman named kathy
proctor had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old and she told me sheâ€™s
earning her degree in biotechnology now at 55 years old not just because the furniture jobs are
gone but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams too as kathy said â€œi
hope it tells them to never give up
if we take these steps if we raise expectations for every child and give them the best possible
chance at an education from the day they are born until the last job they take we will reach
the goal that i set two years ago by the end of the decade america will once again have the
highest proportion of college graduates in the world applause
one last point about education today there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in
our schools who are not american citizens some are the children of undocumented workers
who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents they grew up as americans and pledge
allegiance to our flag and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation others come
here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities but as soon as they obtain advanced
degrees we send them back home to compete against us it makes no sense
now i strongly believe that we should take on once and for all the issue of illegal immigration
and i am prepared to work with republicans and democrats to protect our borders enforce our
laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows
applause i know that debate will be difficult i know it will take time but tonight letâ€™s agree
to make that effort and letâ€™s stop expelling talented responsible young people who could be
staffing our research labs or starting a new business who could be further enriching this nation
applause
the third step in winning the future is rebuilding america to attract new businesses to our
shores we need the fastest most reliable ways to move people goods and information from
high speed rail to high speed internet applause
our infrastructure used to be the best but our lead has slipped south korean homes now have
greater internet access than we do countries in europe and russia invest more in their roads and
railways than we do china is building faster trains and newer airports meanwhile when our
own engineers graded our nationâ€™s infrastructure they gave us a â€œd
we have to do better america is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad brought
electricity to rural communities constructed the interstate highway system the jobs created by
these projects didnâ€™t just come from laying down track or pavement they came from businesses
that opened near a townâ€™s new train station or the new off ramp
so over the last two years weâ€™ve begun rebuilding for the 21st century a project that has meant
thousands of good jobs for the hard hit construction industry and tonight iâ€™m proposing that we
redouble those efforts applause
weâ€™ll put more americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges weâ€™ll make sure this
is fully paid for attract private investment and pick projects based on whatâ€™s best for the
economy not politicians
within 25 years our goal is to give 80 percent of americans access to high speed rail
applause this could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car for some
trips it will be faster than flying without the pat down laughter and applause as we speak
routes in california and the midwest are already underway
within the next five years weâ€™ll make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of
high speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all americans this isnâ€™t just about applause
this isnâ€™t about faster internet or fewer dropped calls itâ€™s about connecting every part of america
to the digital age itâ€™s about a rural community in iowa or alabama where farmers and small
business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world itâ€™s about a firefighter who
can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device a student who can take
classes with a digital textbook or a patient who can have face to face video chats with her
doctor
all these investments in innovation education and infrastructure will make america a
better place to do business and create jobs but to help our companies compete we also have to
knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success
for example over the years a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular
companies and industries those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up
paying no taxes at all but all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the
world it makes no sense and it has to change applause
so tonight iâ€™m asking democrats and republicans to simplify the system get rid of the
loopholes level the playing field and use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the
first time in 25 years without adding to our deficit it can be done applause
to help businesses sell more products abroad we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014
because the more we export the more jobs we create here at home already our exports are up
recently we signed agreements with india and china that will support more than 25000 jobs
here in the united states and last month we finalized a trade agreement with south korea that
will support at least 7000 american jobs this agreement has unprecedented support from
business and labor democrats and republicans and i ask this congress to pass it as soon as
possible applause
now before i took office i made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements and that i
would only sign deals that keep faith with american workers and promote american jobs thatâ€™s
what we did with korea and thatâ€™s what i intend to do as we pursue agreements with panama
and colombia and continue our asia pacific and global trade talks applause
to reduce barriers to growth and investment iâ€™ve ordered a review of government regulations
when we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses we will fix them applause
but i will not hesitate to create or enforce common sense safeguards to protect the american
people applause thatâ€™s what weâ€™ve done in this country for more than a century itâ€™s why our
food is safe to eat our water is safe to drink and our air is safe to breathe itâ€™s why we have
speed limits and child labor laws itâ€™s why last year we put in place consumer protections
against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another
financial crisis applause and itâ€™s why we passed reform that finally prevents the health
insurance industry from exploiting patients applause
now i have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law
laughter so let me be the first to say that anything can be improved if you have ideas about
how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable i am eager to work with you
we can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary
bookkeeping burden on small businesses applause
what iâ€™m not willing to do what iâ€™m not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance
companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition applause
iâ€™m not willing to tell james howard a brain cancer patient from texas that his treatment might
not be covered iâ€™m not willing to tell jim houser a small business man from oregon that he
has to go back to paying $500 more to cover his employees as we speak this law is making
prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their
patientsâ€™ parentsâ€™ coverage applause
so i say to this chamber tonight instead of re fighting the battles of the last two years letâ€™s fix
what needs fixing and letâ€™s move forward applause
now the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we arenâ€™t buried under a
mountain of debt
we are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago and in the wake
of the financial crisis some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing save jobs and put
money in peopleâ€™s pockets
but now that the worst of the recession is over we have to confront the fact that our government
spends more than it takes in that is not sustainable every day families sacrifice to live within
their means they deserve a government that does the same
so tonight i am proposing that starting this year we freeze annual domestic spending for the
next five years applause now this would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over
the next decade and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since
dwight eisenhower was president
this freeze will require painful cuts already weâ€™ve frozen the salaries of hardworking federal
employees for the next two years iâ€™ve proposed cuts to things i care deeply about like
community action programs the secretary of defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of
dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without applause
i recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts and iâ€™m willing to
eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without but letâ€™s make sure that weâ€™re not
doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens applause and letâ€™s make sure that what
weâ€™re cutting is really excess weight cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation
and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine it may make you
feel like youâ€™re flying high at first but it wonâ€™t take long before you feel the impact laughter
now most of the cuts and savings iâ€™ve proposed only address annual domestic spending which
represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget to make further progress we have to stop
pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough it wonâ€™t applause
the bipartisan fiscal commission i created last year made this crystal clear i donâ€™t agree with all
their proposals but they made important progress and their conclusion is that the only way to
tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it in domestic spending
defense spending health care spending and spending through tax breaks and loopholes
applause
this means further reducing health care costs including programs like medicare and medicaid
which are the single biggest contributor to our long term deficit the health insurance law we
passed last year will slow these rising costs which is part of the reason that nonpartisan
economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to
our deficit still iâ€™m willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs including one that
republicans suggested last year medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits
applause
to put us on solid ground we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen social security
for future generations applause we must do it without putting at risk current retirees the
most vulnerable or people with disabilities without slashing benefits for future generations and
without subjecting americansâ€™ guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market
applause
and if we truly care about our deficit we simply canâ€™t afford a permanent extension of the tax
cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans applause before we take money away from
our schools or scholarships away from our students we should ask millionaires to give up their
tax break itâ€™s not a matter of punishing their success itâ€™s about promoting americaâ€™s success
applause
in fact the best thing we could do on taxes for all americans is to simplify the individual tax
code applause this will be a tough job but members of both parties have expressed an
interest in doing this and i am prepared to join them applause
so now is the time to act now is the time for both sides and both houses of congress
democrats and republicans to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done if we
make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits we can make the investments we need to win
the future
let me take this one step further we shouldnâ€™t just give our people a government thatâ€™s more
affordable we should give them a government thatâ€™s more competent and more efficient we
canâ€™t win the future with a government of the past applause
we live and do business in the information age but the last major reorganization of the
government happened in the age of black and white tv there are 12 different agencies that
deal with exports there are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy then
thereâ€™s my favorite example the interior department is in charge of salmon while theyâ€™re in
fresh water but the commerce department handles them when theyâ€™re in saltwater laughter i
hear it gets even more complicated once theyâ€™re smoked laughter and applause
now weâ€™ve made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of
waste veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse
weâ€™re selling acres of federal office space that hasnâ€™t been used in years and weâ€™ll cut through
red tape to get rid of more but we need to think bigger in the coming months my
administration will develop a proposal to merge consolidate and reorganize the federal
government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive america i will submit that
proposal to congress for a vote and we will push to get it passed applause
in the coming year weâ€™ll also work to rebuild peopleâ€™s faith in the institution of government
because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent youâ€™ll be
able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history because you
deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists i ask congress to do
what the white house has already done put that information online and because the
american people deserve to know that special interests arenâ€™t larding up legislation with pet
projects both parties in congress should know this if a bill comes to my desk with earmarks
inside i will veto it i will veto it applause
the 21st century government thatâ€™s open and competent a government that lives within its
means an economy thatâ€™s driven by new skills and new ideas our success in this new and
changing world will require reform responsibility and innovation it will also require us to
approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs
just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders so can new threats and new challenges
no single wall separates east and west no one rival superpower is aligned against us
and so we must defeat determined enemies wherever they are and build coalitions that cut
across lines of region and race and religion and americaâ€™s moral example must always shine
for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity and because weâ€™ve begun this work
tonight we can say that american leadership has been renewed and americaâ€™s standing has been
restored
look to iraq where nearly 10000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held
high applause american combat patrols have ended violence is down and a new government
has been formed this year our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the iraqi people
while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of iraq americaâ€™s commitment has been kept
the iraq war is coming to an end applause
of course as we speak al qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us thanks
to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals weâ€™re disrupting plots and securing our
cities and skies and as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders we are
responding with the strength of our communities with respect for the rule of law and with the
conviction that american muslims are a part of our american family applause
weâ€™ve also taken the fight to al qaeda and their allies abroad in afghanistan our troops have
taken taliban strongholds and trained afghan security forces our purpose is clear by
preventing the taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the afghan people we will deny
al qaeda the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11.
thanks to our heroic troops and civilians fewer afghans are under the control of the insurgency
there will be tough fighting ahead and the afghan government will need to deliver better
governance but we are strengthening the capacity of the afghan people and building an
enduring partnership with them this year we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a
transition to an afghan lead and this july we will begin to bring our troops home applause
in pakistan al qaedaâ€™s leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001. their
leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield their safe havens are shrinking
and weâ€™ve sent a message from the afghan border to the arabian peninsula to all parts of the
globe we will not relent we will not waver and we will defeat you applause
american leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war because
republicans and democrats approved the new start treaty far fewer nuclear weapons and
launchers will be deployed because we rallied the world nuclear materials are being locked
down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists applause
because of a diplomatic effort to insist that iran meet its obligations the iranian government now
faces tougher sanctions tighter sanctions than ever before and on the korean peninsula we
stand with our ally south korea and insist that north korea keeps its commitment to abandon
nuclear weapons applause
this is just a part of how weâ€™re shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity with our
european allies we revitalized nato and increased our cooperation on everything from
counterterrorism to missile defense weâ€™ve reset our relationship with russia strengthened
asian alliances built new partnerships with nations like india
this march i will travel to brazil chile and el salvador to forge new alliances across the
americas around the globe weâ€™re standing with those who take responsibility helping
farmers grow more food supporting doctors who care for the sick and combating the corruption
that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity
recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power it must also be
the purpose behind it in south sudan with our assistance the people were finally able to
vote for independence after years of war applause thousands lined up before dawn people
danced in the streets one man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around
him â€œthis was a battlefield for most of my life he said â€œnow we want to be free applause
and we saw that same desire to be free in tunisia where the will of the people proved more
powerful than the writ of a dictator and tonight let us be clear the united states of america
stands with the people of tunisia and supports the democratic aspirations of all people
applause
we must never forget that the things weâ€™ve struggled for and fought for live in the hearts of
people everywhere and we must always remember that the americans who have borne the
greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country applause
tonight let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our
troops and their families let us serve them as well as theyâ€™ve served us by giving them the
equipment they need by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned and by
enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation
our troops come from every corner of this country theyâ€™re black white latino asian native
american they are christian and hindu jewish and muslim and yes we know that some of
them are gay starting this year no american will be forbidden from serving the country they
love because of who they love applause and with that change i call on all our college
campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and rotc it is time to leave behind the
divisive battles of the past it is time to move forward as one nation applause
we should have no illusions about the work ahead of us reforming our schools changing the
way we use energy reducing our deficit none of this will be easy all of it will take time and
it will be harder because we will argue about everything the costs the details the letter of
every law
of course some countries donâ€™t have this problem if the central government wants a railroad
they build a railroad no matter how many homes get bulldozed if they donâ€™t want a bad story in
the newspaper it doesnâ€™t get written
and yet as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be i know
there isnâ€™t a person here who would trade places with any other nation on earth applause
we may have differences in policy but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our constitution
we may have different opinions but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place
where you can make it if you try we may have different backgrounds but we believe in the
same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible no matter who you are no
matter where you come from
that dream is why i can stand here before you tonight that dream is why a working class kid
from scranton can sit behind me laughter and applause that dream is why someone who
began by sweeping the floors of his fatherâ€™s cincinnati bar can preside as speaker of the house
in the greatest nation on earth applause
that dream that american dream is what drove the allen brothers to reinvent their roofing
company for a new era itâ€™s what drove those students at forsyth tech to learn a new skill and
work towards the future and that dream is the story of a small business owner named brandon
fisher
brandon started a company in berlin pennsylvania that specializes in a new kind of drilling
technology and one day last summer he saw the news that halfway across the world 33 men
were trapped in a chilean mine and no one knew how to save them
but brandon thought his company could help and so he designed a rescue that would come to
be known as plan b his employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary
drilling equipment and brandon left for chile
along with others he began drilling a 200- foot hole into the ground working three or four
hour three or four days at a time without any sleep thirty seven days later plan b succeeded
and the miners were rescued applause but because he didnâ€™t want all of the attention
brandon wasnâ€™t there when the miners emerged heâ€™d already gone back home back to work on
his next project
and later one of his employees said of the rescue â€œwe proved that center rock is a little
company but we do big things applause
we do big things
from the earliest days of our founding america has been the story of ordinary people who dare
to dream thatâ€™s how we win the future
weâ€™re a nation that says â€œi might not have a lot of money but i have this great idea for a new
company â€œi might not come from a family of college graduates but i will be the first to get my
degree â€œi might not know those people in trouble but i think i can help them and i need to
try â€œiâ€™m not sure how weâ€™ll reach that better place beyond the horizon but i know weâ€™ll get
there i know we will
we do big things applause
the idea of america endures our destiny remains our choice and tonight more than two
centuries later itâ€™s because of our people that our future is hopeful our journey goes forward
and the state of our union is strong
thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america applause
mr. speaker mr. vice president members of congress distinguished guests and
fellow americans
last month i went to andrews air force base and welcomed home some of our last
troops to serve in iraq together we offered a final proud salute to the colors under
which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought and several thousand gave
their lives
we gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the united states
safer and more respected around the world for the first time in nine years there are no
americans fighting in iraq for the first time in two decades osama bin laden is not a
threat to this country most of al qaedaâ€™s top lieutenants have been defeated the
talibanâ€™s momentum has been broken and some troops in afghanistan have begun to
come home
these achievements are a testament to the courage selflessness and teamwork of
americaâ€™s armed forces at a time when too many of our institutions have let us
down they exceed all expectations theyâ€™re not consumed with personal ambition
they donâ€™t obsess over their differences they focus on the mission at hand they
work together
imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example think about the
america within our reach a country that leads the world in educating its people an
america that attracts a new generation of high tech manufacturing and high paying
jobs a future where weâ€™re in control of our own energy and our security and
prosperity arenâ€™t so tied to unstable parts of the world an economy built to last where
hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded
we can do this i know we can because weâ€™ve done it before at the end of world war
ii when another generation of heroes returned home from combat they built the
strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known my grandfather a
veteran of pattonâ€™s army got the chance to go to college on the gi bill my
grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line was part of a workforce that
turned out the best products on earth
the two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression
and fascism they understood they were part of something larger that they were
contributing to a story of success that every american had a chance to share the basic
american promise that if you worked hard you could do well enough to raise a family
own a home send your kids to college and put a little away for retirement
the defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive no challenge is more
urgent no debate is more important we can either settle for a country where a
shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of americans
barely get by or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot everyone
does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules whatâ€™s at stake are
not democratic values or republican values but american values we have to reclaim
them
letâ€™s remember how we got here long before the recession jobs and manufacturing
began leaving our shores technology made businesses more efficient but also made
some jobs obsolete folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before but most
hardworking americans struggled with costs that were growing paychecks that
werenâ€™t and personal debt that kept piling up
in 2008, the house of cards collapsed we learned that mortgages had been sold to
people who couldnâ€™t afford or understand them banks had made huge bets and
bonuses with other peopleâ€™s money regulators had looked the other way or didnâ€™t
have the authority to stop the bad behavior
it was wrong it was irresponsible and it plunged our economy into a crisis that put
millions out of work saddled us with more debt and left innocent hard working
americans holding the bag in the six months before i took office we lost nearly four
million jobs and we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect
those are the facts but so are these in the last 22 months businesses have created
more than three million jobs last year they created the most jobs since 2005.
american manufacturers are hiring again creating jobs for the first time since the late
1990s together weâ€™ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion and weâ€™ve
put in place new rules to hold wall street accountable so a crisis like that never
happens again
the state of our union is getting stronger and weâ€™ve come too far to turn back now
as long as iâ€™m president i will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this
momentum but i intend to fight obstruction with action and i will oppose any effort
to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place
no we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing bad debt and phony
financial profits tonight i want to speak about how we move forward and lay out a
blueprint for an economy thatâ€™s built to last an economy built on american
manufacturing american energy skills for american workers and a renewal of
american values
this blueprint begins with american manufacturing
on the day i took office our auto industry was on the verge of collapse some even
said we should let it die with a million jobs at stake i refused to let that happen in
exchange for help we demanded responsibility we got workers and automakers to
settle their differences we got the industry to retool and restructure today general
motors is back on top as the worldâ€™s number one automaker chrysler has grown faster
in the u s than any major car company ford is investing billions in u s plants and
factories and together the entire industry added nearly 16000 jobs
we bet on american workers we bet on american ingenuity and tonight the
american auto industry is back
whatâ€™s happening in detroit can happen in other industries it can happen in
cleveland and pittsburgh and raleigh we canâ€™t bring back every job thatâ€™s left our
shores but right now itâ€™s getting more expensive to do business in places like china
meanwhile america is more productive a few weeks ago the ceo of master lock
told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home today for
the first time in fifteen years master lockâ€™s unionized plant in milwaukee is running at
full capacity
so we have a huge opportunity at this moment to bring manufacturing back but we
have to seize it tonight my message to business leaders is simple ask yourselves
what you can do to bring jobs back to your country and your country will do
everything we can to help you succeed
we should start with our tax code right now companies get tax breaks for moving
jobs and profits overseas meanwhile companies that choose to stay in america get hit
with one of the highest tax rates in the world it makes no sense and everyone knows
it
so letâ€™s change it first if youâ€™re a business that wants to outsource jobs you shouldnâ€™t
get a tax deduction for doing it that money should be used to cover moving expenses
for companies like master lock that decide to bring jobs home
second no american company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by
moving jobs and profits overseas from now on every multinational company should
have to pay a basic minimum tax and every penny should go towards lowering taxes
for companies that choose to stay here and hire here
third if youâ€™re an american manufacturer you should get a bigger tax cut if youâ€™re a
high tech manufacturer we should double the tax deduction you get for making
products here and if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a
factory left town you should get help financing a new plant equipment or training for
new workers
my message is simple itâ€™s time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas
and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in america send me these
tax reforms and iâ€™ll sign them right away
weâ€™re also making it easier for american businesses to sell products all over the world
two years ago i set a goal of doubling u s exports over five years with the bipartisan
trade agreements i signed into law we are on track to meet that goal ahead of
schedule soon there will be millions of new customers for american goods in
panama colombia and south korea soon there will be new cars on the streets of
seoul imported from detroit and toledo and chicago
i will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for american products and i
will not stand by when our competitors donâ€™t play by the rules weâ€™ve brought trade
cases against china at nearly twice the rate as the last administration and itâ€™s made a
difference over a thousand americans are working today because we stopped a surge
in chinese tires but we need to do more itâ€™s not right when another country lets our
movies music and software be pirated itâ€™s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a
leg up on ours only because theyâ€™re heavily subsidized
tonight iâ€™m announcing the creation of a trade enforcement unit that will be charged
with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like china there will be more
inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders and this
congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over american
manufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets like russia our
workers are the most productive on earth and if the playing field is level i promise
you america will always win
i also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the united states but canâ€™t
find workers with the right skills growing industries in science and technology have
twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job think about that
openings at a time when millions of americans are looking for work
thatâ€™s inexcusable and we know how to fix it
jackie bray is a single mom from north carolina who was laid off from her job as a
mechanic then siemens opened a gas turbine factory in charlotte and formed a
partnership with central piedmont community college the company helped the
college design courses in laser and robotics training it paid jackieâ€™s tuition then hired
her to help operate their plant
i want every american looking for work to have the same opportunity as jackie did
join me in a national commitment to train two million americans with skills that will
lead directly to a job my administration has already lined up more companies that
want to help model partnerships between businesses like siemens and community
colleges in places like charlotte orlando and louisville are up and running now you
need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community
career centers places that teach people skills that local businesses are looking for right
now from data management to high tech manufacturing
and i want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs so that from now
on people like jackie have one program one website and one place to go for all the
information and help they need itâ€™s time to turn our unemployment system into a
reemployment system that puts people to work
these reforms will help people get jobs that are open today but to prepare for the jobs
of tomorrow our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier
for less than one percent of what our nation spends on education each year weâ€™ve
convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and
learning the first time thatâ€™s happened in a generation
but challenges remain and we know how to solve them
at a time when other countries are doubling down on education tight budgets have
forced states to lay off thousands of teachers we know a good teacher can increase the
lifetime income of a classroom by over $25000. a great teacher can offer an escape
from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance every person in this
chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives most teachers
work tirelessly with modest pay sometimes digging into their own pocket for school
supplies just to make a difference
teachers matter so instead of bashing them or defending the status quo letâ€™s offer
schools a deal give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job and reward
the best ones in return grant schools flexibility to teach with creativity and passion
to stop teaching to the test and to replace teachers who just arenâ€™t helping kids learn
we also know that when students arenâ€™t allowed to walk away from their education
more of them walk the stage to get their diploma so tonight i call on every state to
require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn eighteen
when kids do graduate the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college at a
time when americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt this congress
needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in july extend the
tuition tax credit we started that saves middle class families thousands of dollars and
give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the
number of work study jobs in the next five years
of course itâ€™s not enough for us to increase student aid we canâ€™t just keep subsidizing
skyrocketing tuition weâ€™ll run out of money states also need to do their part by
making higher education a higher priority in their budgets and colleges and
universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down recently i spoke
with a group of college presidents whoâ€™ve done just that some schools re design
courses to help students finish more quickly some use better technology the point is
itâ€™s possible so let me put colleges and universities on notice if you canâ€™t stop tuition
from going up the funding you get from taxpayers will go down higher education
canâ€™t be a luxury itâ€™s an economic imperative that every family in america should be
able to afford
letâ€™s also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented hardworking students in
this country face another challenge the fact that they arenâ€™t yet american citizens
many were brought here as small children are american through and through yet they
live every day with the threat of deportation others came more recently to study
business and science and engineering but as soon as they get their degree we send
them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else
that doesnâ€™t make sense
i believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration thatâ€™s why my
administration has put more boots on the border than ever before thatâ€™s why there
are fewer illegal crossings than when i took office
the opponents of action are out of excuses we should be working on comprehensive
immigration reform right now but if election year politics keeps congress from acting
on a comprehensive plan letâ€™s at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people
who want to staff our labs start new businesses and defend this country send me a
law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship i will sign it right away
you see an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of
every person in this country that means women should earn equal pay for equal
work it means we should support everyone whoâ€™s willing to work and every risk
taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next steve jobs
after all innovation is what america has always been about most new jobs are created
in start ups and small businesses so letâ€™s pass an agenda that helps them succeed
tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing
to grow expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good
jobs both parties agree on these ideas so put them in a bill and get it on my desk this
year
innovation also demands basic research today the discoveries taking place in our
federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer
cells but leave healthy ones untouched new lightweight vests for cops and soldiers
that can stop any bullet donâ€™t gut these investments in our budget donâ€™t let other
countries win the race for the future support the same kind of research and innovation
that led to the computer chip and the internet to new american jobs and new american
industries
nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in american made energy over the
last three years weâ€™ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration and
tonight iâ€™m directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential
offshore oil and gas resources right now american oil production is the highest that
itâ€™s been in eight years thatâ€™s right eight years not only that last year we relied
less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years
but with only 2 percent of the worldâ€™s oil reserves oil isnâ€™t enough this country needs
an all out all of the above strategy that develops every available source of american
energy a strategy thatâ€™s cleaner cheaper and full of new jobs
we have a supply of natural gas that can last america nearly one hundred years and
my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy
experts believe this will support more than 60000 jobs by the end of the decade and
iâ€™m requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals
they use america will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of
our citizens at risk
the development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are
cleaner and cheaper proving that we donâ€™t have to choose between our environment
and our economy and by the way it was public research dollars over the course of
thirty years that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of
shale rock reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get
new energy ideas off the ground
whatâ€™s true for natural gas is true for clean energy in three years our partnership with
the private sector has already positioned america to be the worldâ€™s leading
manufacturer of high tech batteries because of federal investments renewable energy
use has nearly doubled and thousands of americans have jobs because of it
when bryan ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture he said he worried that
at 55, no one would give him a second chance but he found work at energetx a wind
turbine manufacturer in michigan before the recession the factory only made luxury
yachts today itâ€™s hiring workers like bryan who said â€œiâ€™m proud to be working in
the industry of the future
our experience with shale gas shows us that the payoffs on these public investments
donâ€™t always come right away some technologies donâ€™t pan out some companies fail
but i will not walk away from the promise of clean energy i will not walk away from
workers like bryan i will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to china or
germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here we have subsidized
oil companies for a century thatâ€™s long enough itâ€™s time to end the taxpayer
giveaways to an industry thatâ€™s rarely been more profitable and double down on a
clean energy industry thatâ€™s never been more promising pass clean energy tax credits
and create these jobs
we can also spur energy innovation with new incentives the differences in this
chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate
change but thereâ€™s no reason why congress shouldnâ€™t at least set a clean energy
standard that creates a market for innovation so far you havenâ€™t acted well tonight i
will iâ€™m directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on
enough public land to power three million homes and iâ€™m proud to announce that the
department of defense the worldâ€™s largest consumer of energy will make one of the
largest commitments to clean energy in history with the navy purchasing enough
capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year
of course the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy so hereâ€™s another
proposal help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give
businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings their energy bills will be $100 billion
lower over the next decade and america will have less pollution more manufacturing
and more jobs for construction workers who need them send me a bill that creates
these jobs
building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair
americaâ€™s infrastructure so much of america needs to be rebuilt weâ€™ve got
crumbling roads and bridges a power grid that wastes too much energy an
incomplete high speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in
rural america from selling her products all over the world
during the great depression america built the hoover dam and the golden gate
bridge after world war ii we connected our states with a system of highways
democratic and republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited
everybody from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today
in the next few weeks i will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that
slows down too many construction projects but you need to fund these projects take
the money weâ€™re no longer spending at war use half of it to pay down our debt and
use the rest to do some nation building right here at home
thereâ€™s never been a better time to build especially since the construction industry was
one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst of course construction workers
werenâ€™t the only ones hurt so were millions of innocent americans whoâ€™ve seen their
home values decline and while government canâ€™t fix the problem on its own
responsible homeowners shouldnâ€™t have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit
bottom to get some relief
thatâ€™s why iâ€™m sending this congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner
the chance to save about $300 a year on their mortgage by refinancing at historically
low interest rates no more red tape no more runaround from the banks a small fee
on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it wonâ€™t add to the deficit and will
give banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust
letâ€™s never forget millions of americans who work hard and play by the rules every
day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same itâ€™s time to apply
the same rules from top to bottom no bailouts no handouts and no copouts an
america built to last insists on responsibility from everybody
weâ€™ve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldnâ€™t afford
them and buyers who knew they couldnâ€™t afford them thatâ€™s why we need smart
regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic
dumping or faulty medical devices donâ€™t destroy the free market they make the free
market work better
there is no question that some regulations are outdated unnecessary or too costly in
fact iâ€™ve approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my
republican predecessor did in his iâ€™ve ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules
that donâ€™t make sense weâ€™ve already announced over 500 reforms and just a fraction
of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next five years
we got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to
spend $1000 a year proving that they could contain a spill because milk was
somehow classified as an oil with a rule like that i guess it was worth crying over
spilled milk
iâ€™m confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over
his shoulder but i will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain
the kind of oil spill we saw in the gulf two years ago i will not back down from
protecting our kids from mercury pollution or making sure that our food is safe and
our water is clean i will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had
unchecked power to cancel your policy deny you coverage or charge women
differently from men
and i will not go back to the days when wall street was allowed to play by its own set
of rules the new rules we passed restore what should be any financial systemâ€™s core
purpose getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas and getting loans to
responsible families who want to buy a home start a business or send a kid to college
so if youâ€™re a big bank or financial institution you are no longer allowed to make risky
bets with your customersâ€™ deposits youâ€™re required to write out a â€œliving willâ€ that
details exactly how youâ€™ll pay the bills if you fail because the rest of us arenâ€™t bailing
you out ever again and if youâ€™re a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card
company the days of signing people up for products they canâ€™t afford with confusing
forms and deceptive practices are over today american consumers finally have a
watchdog in richard cordray with one job to look out for them
we will also establish a financial crimes unit of highly trained investigators to crack
down on large scale fraud and protect peopleâ€™s investments some financial firms
violate major anti fraud laws because thereâ€™s no real penalty for being a repeat
offender thatâ€™s bad for consumers and itâ€™s bad for the vast majority of bankers and
financial service professionals who do the right thing so pass legislation that makes
the penalties for fraud count
and tonight i am asking my attorney general to create a special unit of federal
prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand our investigations into the
abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis this
new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law speed assistance to
homeowners and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many
americans
a return to the american values of fair play and shared responsibility will help us
protect our people and our economy but it should also guide us as we look to pay
down our debt and invest in our future
right now our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working
americans while the recovery is still fragile people cannot afford losing $40 out of each
paycheck this year there are plenty of ways to get this done so letâ€™s agree right here
right now no side issues no drama pass the payroll tax cut without delay
when it comes to the deficit weâ€™ve already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and
savings but we need to do more and that means making choices right now weâ€™re
poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax
break for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans right now because of loopholes and
shelters in the tax code a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of
middle class households right now warren buffett pays a lower tax rate than his
secretary
do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest americans or do we want to
keep our investments in everything else like education and medical research a strong
military and care for our veterans because if weâ€™re serious about paying down our
debt we canâ€™t do both
the american people know what the right choice is so do i as i told the speaker this
summer iâ€™m prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long term costs of
medicare and medicaid and strengthen social security so long as those programs
remain a guarantee of security for seniors
but in return we need to change our tax code so that people like me and an awful lot of
members of congress pay our fair share of taxes tax reform should follow the buffett
rule if you make more than $1 million a year you should not pay less than 30 percent
in taxes and my republican friend tom coburn is right washington should stop
subsidizing millionaires in fact if youâ€™re earning a million dollars a year you
shouldnâ€™t get special tax subsidies or deductions on the other hand if you make under
$25000 a year like 98 percent of american families your taxes shouldnâ€™t go up
youâ€™re the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages youâ€™re the ones who
need relief
now you can call this class warfare all you want but asking a billionaire to pay at least
as much as his secretary in taxes most americans would call that common sense
we donâ€™t begrudge financial success in this country we admire it when americans
talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes itâ€™s not because they envy the
rich itâ€™s because they understand that when i get tax breaks i donâ€™t need and the
country canâ€™t afford it either adds to the deficit or somebody else has to make up the
difference like a senior on a fixed income or a student trying to get through school or
a family trying to make ends meet thatâ€™s not right americans know itâ€™s not right
they know that this generationâ€™s success is only possible because past generations felt a
responsibility to each other and to their countryâ€™s future and they know our way of life
will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility thatâ€™s how weâ€™ll
reduce our deficit thatâ€™s an america built to last
i recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt
energy and health care but no matter what party they belong to i bet most americans
are thinking the same thing right now nothing will get done this year or next year or
maybe even the year after that because washington is broken
can you blame them for feeling a little cynical
the greatest blow to confidence in our economy last year didnâ€™t come from events
beyond our control it came from a debate in washington over whether the united
states would pay its bills or not who benefited from that fiasco
iâ€™ve talked tonight about the deficit of trust between main street and wall street but
the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad and it seems
to get worse every year
some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics so together
letâ€™s take some steps to fix that send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of
congress and i will sign it tomorrow letâ€™s limit any elected official from owning
stocks in industries they impact letâ€™s make sure people who bundle campaign
contributions for congress canâ€™t lobby congress and vice versa an idea that has
bipartisan support at least outside of washington
some of whatâ€™s broken has to do with the way congress does its business these days a
simple majority is no longer enough to get anything even routine business passed
through the senate neither party has been blameless in these tactics now both parties
should put an end to it for starters i ask the senate to pass a rule that all judicial and
public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days
the executive branch also needs to change too often itâ€™s inefficient outdated and
remote thatâ€™s why iâ€™ve asked this congress to grant me the authority to consolidate
the federal bureaucracy so that our government is leaner quicker and more responsive
to the needs of the american people
finally none of these reforms can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this
town we need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual
campaign of mutual destruction that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies
instead of building consensus around common sense ideas
iâ€™m a democrat but i believe what republican abraham lincoln believed that
government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves and
no more thatâ€™s why my education reform offers more competition and more control
for schools and states thatâ€™s why weâ€™re getting rid of regulations that donâ€™t work
thatâ€™s why our health care law relies on a reformed private market not a government
program
on the other hand even my republican friends who complain the most about
government spending have supported federally financed roads and clean energy
projects and federal offices for the folks back home
the point is we should all want a smarter more effective government and while we
may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year we can make
real progress with or without this congress i will keep taking actions that help the
economy grow but i can do a whole lot more with your help because when we act
together there is nothing the united states of america canâ€™t achieve
that is the lesson weâ€™ve learned from our actions abroad over the last few years
ending the iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies from
pakistan to yemen the al qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling knowing that
they canâ€™t escape the reach of the united states of america
from this position of strength weâ€™ve begun to wind down the war in afghanistan ten
thousand of our troops have come home twenty three thousand more will leave by
the end of this summer this transition to afghan lead will continue and we will build
an enduring partnership with afghanistan so that it is never again a source of attacks
against america
as the tide of war recedes a wave of change has washed across the middle east and
north africa from tunis to cairo from sanaâ€™a to tripoli a year ago qadhafi was one
of the worldâ€™s longest serving dictators a murderer with american blood on his
hands today he is gone and in syria i have no doubt that the assad regime will
soon discover that the forces of change canâ€™t be reversed and that human dignity canâ€™t
be denied
how this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain but we have a huge
stake in the outcome and while it is ultimately up to the people of the region to decide
their fate we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well
we will stand against violence and intimidation we will stand for the rights and
dignity of all human beings men and women christians muslims and jews we will
support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets because
tyranny is no match for liberty
and we will safeguard americaâ€™s own security against those who threaten our citizens
our friends and our interests look at iran through the power of our diplomacy a
world that was once divided about how to deal with iranâ€™s nuclear program now stands
as one the regime is more isolated than ever before its leaders are faced with
crippling sanctions and as long as they shirk their responsibilities this pressure will not
relent let there be no doubt america is determined to prevent iran from getting a
nuclear weapon and i will take no options off the table to achieve that goal but a
peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible and far better and if iran changes
course and meets its obligations it can rejoin the community of nations
the renewal of american leadership can be felt across the globe our oldest alliances in
europe and asia are stronger than ever our ties to the americas are deeper our iron
clad commitment to israelâ€™s security has meant the closest military cooperation between
our two countries in history weâ€™ve made it clear that america is a pacific power and a
new beginning in burma has lit a new hope from the coalitions weâ€™ve built to secure
nuclear materials to the missions weâ€™ve led against hunger and disease from the blows
weâ€™ve dealt to our enemies to the enduring power of our moral example america is
back
anyone who tells you otherwise anyone who tells you that america is in decline or
that our influence has waned doesnâ€™t know what theyâ€™re talking about thatâ€™s not the
message we get from leaders around the world all of whom are eager to work with us
thatâ€™s not how people feel from tokyo to berlin from cape town to rio where
opinions of america are higher than theyâ€™ve been in years yes the world is changing
no we canâ€™t control every event but america remains the one indispensable nation in
world affairs and as long as iâ€™m president i intend to keep it that way
thatâ€™s why working with our military leaders i have proposed a new defense strategy
that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world while saving nearly half a
trillion dollars in our budget to stay one step ahead of our adversaries i have already
sent this congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing danger of
cyber threats
above all our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend
it as they come home we must serve them as well as they served us that includes
giving them the care and benefits they have earned which is why weâ€™ve increased
annual va spending every year iâ€™ve been president and it means enlisting our
veterans in the work of rebuilding our nation
with the bipartisan support of this congress we are providing new tax credits to
companies that hire vets michelle and jill biden have worked with american
businesses to secure a pledge of 13500 jobs for veterans and their families and
tonight iâ€™m proposing a veterans job corps that will help our communities hire
veterans as cops and firefighters so that america is as strong as those who defend her
which brings me back to where i began those of us whoâ€™ve been sent here to serve can
learn from the service of our troops when you put on that uniform it doesnâ€™t matter if
youâ€™re black or white asian or latino conservative or liberal rich or poor gay or
straight when youâ€™re marching into battle you look out for the person next to you or
the mission fails when youâ€™re in the thick of the fight you rise or fall as one unit
serving one nation leaving no one behind
one of my proudest possessions is the flag that the seal team took with them on the
mission to get bin laden on it are each of their names some may be democrats
some may be republicans but that doesnâ€™t matter just like it didnâ€™t matter that day in
the situation room when i sat next to bob gates a man who was george bushâ€™s
defense secretary and hillary clinton a woman who ran against me for president
all that mattered that day was the mission no one thought about politics no one
thought about themselves one of the young men involved in the raid later told me that
he didnâ€™t deserve credit for the mission it only succeeded he said because every
single member of that unit did their job the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun
out of control the translator who kept others from entering the compound the troops
who separated the women and children from the fight the seals who charged up the
stairs more than that the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit
trusted each other because you canâ€™t charge up those stairs into darkness and danger
unless you know that thereâ€™s someone behind you watching your back
so it is with america each time i look at that flag iâ€™m reminded that our destiny is
stitched together like those fifty stars and those thirteen stripes no one built this
country on their own this nation is great because we built it together this nation is
great because we worked as a team this nation is great because we get each otherâ€™s
backs and if we hold fast to that truth in this moment of trial there is no challenge too
great no mission too hard as long as weâ€™re joined in common purpose as long as we
maintain our common resolve our journey moves forward our future is hopeful and
the state of our union will always be strong
thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america
mr. speaker mr. vice president members of congress fellow citizens
fifty one years ago john f kennedy declared to this chamber that â€œthe constitution
makes us not rivals for power but partners for progressâ€¦it is my task he said â€œto
report the state of the union to improve it is the task of us all
tonight thanks to the grit and determination of the american people there is much
progress to report after a decade of grinding war our brave men and women in
uniform are coming home after years of grueling recession our businesses have
created over six million new jobs we buy more american cars than we have in five
years and less foreign oil than we have in twenty our housing market is healing our
stock market is rebounding and consumers patients and homeowners enjoy stronger
protections than ever before
together we have cleared away the rubble of crisis and can say with renewed
confidence that the state of our union is stronger
but we gather here knowing that there are millions of americans whose hard work and
dedication have not yet been rewarded our economy is adding jobs but too many
people still canâ€™t find full time employment corporate profits have rocketed to all time
highs but for more than a decade wages and incomes have barely budged
it is our generationâ€™s task then to reignite the true engine of americaâ€™s economic
growth a rising thriving middle class
it is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country the idea
that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities you can get ahead no matter
where you come from what you look like or who you love
it is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the
many and not just the few that it encourages free enterprise rewards individual
initiative and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation
the american people donâ€™t expect government to solve every problem they donâ€™t
expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue but they do expect us to put
the nationâ€™s interests before party they do expect us to forge reasonable compromise
where we can for they know that america moves forward only when we do so
together and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all
our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget decisions that
will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery
over the last few years both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more
than $2 trillion mostly through spending cuts but also by raising tax rates on the
wealthiest 1 percent of americans as a result we are more than halfway towards the
goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our
finances
now we need to finish the job and the question is how
in 2011, congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldnâ€™t agree on a plan to
reach our deficit goal about a trillion dollarsâ€™ worth of budget cuts would automatically
go into effect this year these sudden harsh arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our
military readiness theyâ€™d devastate priorities like education energy and medical
research they would certainly slow our recovery and cost us hundreds of thousands
of jobs thatâ€™s why democrats republicans business leaders and economists have
already said that these cuts known here in washington as â€œthe sequester are a really
bad idea
now some in this congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making
even bigger cuts to things like education and job training medicare and social security
benefits
that idea is even worse yes the biggest driver of our long term debt is the rising cost
of health care for an aging population and those of us who care deeply about
programs like medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms otherwise our
retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children and
jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations
but we canâ€™t ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of
deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and most powerful
we wonâ€™t grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college
onto families that are already struggling or by forcing communities to lay off more
teachers cops and firefighters most americans democrats republicans and
independents understand that we canâ€™t just cut our way to prosperity they know
that broad based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction
with spending cuts and revenue and with everybody doing their fair share and thatâ€™s
the approach i offer tonight
on medicare iâ€™m prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of
health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the
bipartisan simpson bowles commission already the affordable care act is helping to
slow the growth of health care costs the reforms iâ€™m proposing go even further weâ€™ll
reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the
wealthiest seniors weâ€™ll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays
for medicare because our medical bills shouldnâ€™t be based on the number of tests
ordered or days spent in the hospital they should be based on the quality of care that
our seniors receive and i am open to additional reforms from both parties so long as
they donâ€™t violate the guarantee of a secure retirement our government shouldnâ€™t
make promises we cannot keep but we must keep the promises weâ€™ve already made
to hit the rest of our deficit reduction target we should do what leaders in both parties
have already suggested and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax
loopholes and deductions for the well off and well connected after all why would we
choose to make deeper cuts to education and medicare just to protect special interest tax
breaks how is that fair how does that promote growth
now is our best chance for bipartisan comprehensive tax reform that encourages job
creation and helps bring down the deficit the american people deserve a tax code that
helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms and more time
expanding and hiring a tax code that ensures billionaires with high powered
accountants canâ€™t pay a lower rate than their hard working secretaries a tax code that
lowers incentives to move jobs overseas and lowers tax rates for businesses and
manufacturers that create jobs right here in america thatâ€™s what tax reform can
deliver thatâ€™s what we can do together
i realize that tax reform and entitlement reform wonâ€™t be easy the politics will be hard
for both sides none of us will get 100 percent of what we want but the alternative
will cost us jobs hurt our economy and visit hardship on millions of hardworking
americans so letâ€™s set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces
reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future and letâ€™s do it
without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors the
greatest nation on earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one
manufactured crisis to the next letâ€™s agree right here right now to keep the peopleâ€™s
government open pay our bills on time and always uphold the full faith and credit of
the united states of america the american people have worked too hard for too long
rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another
now most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda but
letâ€™s be clear deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan a growing economy that
creates good middle class jobs that must be the north star that guides our efforts
every day we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation how do we attract
more jobs to our shores how do we equip our people with the skills needed to do
those jobs and how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living
a year and a half ago i put forward an american jobs act that independent economists
said would create more than one million new jobs i thank the last congress for passing
some of that agenda and i urge this congress to pass the rest tonight iâ€™ll lay out
additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget
framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago let me repeat nothing iâ€™m
proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime itâ€™s not a bigger
government we need but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in
broad based growth
our first priority is making america a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing
after shedding jobs for more than 10 years our manufacturers have added about
50000 jobs over the past three caterpillar is bringing jobs back from japan ford is
bringing jobs back from mexico after locating plants in other countries like china intel
is opening its most advanced plant right here at home and this year apple will start
making macs in america again
there are things we can do right now to accelerate this trend last year we created
our first manufacturing innovation institute in youngstown ohio a once shuttered
warehouse is now a state of the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3d
printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything
thereâ€™s no reason this canâ€™t happen in other towns so tonight iâ€™m announcing the
launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs where businesses will partner with
the departments of defense and energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into
global centers of high tech jobs and i ask this congress to help create a network of
fifteen of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made
in america
if we want to make the best products we also have to invest in the best ideas every
dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy today
our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to alzheimerâ€™s
developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs devising new material to make
batteries ten times more powerful now is not the time to gut these job creating
investments in science and innovation now is the time to reach a level of research and
development not seen since the height of the space race and today no area holds
more promise than our investments in american energy
after years of talking about it we are finally poised to control our own energy future
we produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years we have doubled the distance
our cars will go on a gallon of gas and the amount of renewable energy we generate
from sources like wind and solar with tens of thousands of good american jobs to
show for it we produce more natural gas than ever before and nearly everyoneâ€™s
energy bill is lower because of it and over the last four years our emissions of the
dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen
but for the sake of our children and our future we must do more to combat climate
change yes itâ€™s true that no single event makes a trend but the fact is the 12 hottest
years on record have all come in the last 15. heat waves droughts wildfires and
floods all are now more frequent and intense we can choose to believe that
superstorm sandy and the most severe drought in decades and the worst wildfires
some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence or we can choose to
believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before itâ€™s too late
the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong
economic growth i urge this congress to pursue a bipartisan market based solution to
climate change like the one john mccain and joe lieberman worked on together a few
years ago but if congress wonâ€™t act soon to protect future generations i will i will
direct my cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take now and in the
future to reduce pollution prepare our communities for the consequences of climate
change and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy
four years ago other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that
came with it weâ€™ve begun to change that last year wind energy added nearly half of
all new power capacity in america so letâ€™s generate even more solar energy gets
cheaper by the year so letâ€™s drive costs down even further as long as countries like
china keep going all in on clean energy so must we
in the meantime the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy
independence thatâ€™s why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding
up new oil and gas permits but i also want to work with this congress to encourage
the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our
air and water
indeed much of our new found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we the
public own together so tonight i propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to
fund an energy security trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our
cars and trucks off oil for good if a non partisan coalition of ceos and retired generals
and admirals can get behind this idea then so can we letâ€™s take their advice and free
our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices weâ€™ve put up with for
far too long iâ€™m also issuing a new goal for america letâ€™s cut in half the energy wasted
by our homes and businesses over the next twenty years the states with the best ideas
to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will
receive federal support to help make it happen
americaâ€™s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of
repair ask any ceo where theyâ€™d rather locate and hire a country with deteriorating
roads and bridges or one with high speed rail and internet high tech schools and self
healing power grids the ceo of siemens america a company that brought hundreds
of new jobs to north carolina has said that if we upgrade our infrastructure theyâ€™ll
bring even more jobs and i know that you want these job creating projects in your
districts iâ€™ve seen you all at the ribbon cuttings
tonight i propose a â€œfix it firstâ€ program to put people to work as soon as possible on
our most urgent repairs like the nearly 7000 structurally deficient bridges across the
country and to make sure taxpayers donâ€™t shoulder the whole burden iâ€™m also
proposing a partnership to rebuild america that attracts private capital to upgrade
what our businesses need most modern ports to move our goods modern pipelines to
withstand a storm modern schools worthy of our children letâ€™s prove that there is no
better place to do business than the united states of america and letâ€™s start right
away
part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector today our housing
market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007. home prices are rising at the fastest
pace in six years home purchases are up nearly 50 percent and construction is
expanding again
but even with mortgage rates near a 50- year low too many families with solid credit
who want to buy a home are being rejected too many families who have never missed
a payment and want to refinance are being told no thatâ€™s holding our entire economy
back and we need to fix it right now thereâ€™s a bill in this congress that would give
every responsible homeowner in america the chance to save $300 a year by
refinancing at todayâ€™s rates democrats and republicans have supported it before
what are we waiting for take a vote and send me that bill right now overlapping
regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home whatâ€™s
holding us back letâ€™s streamline the process and help our economy grow
these initiatives in manufacturing energy infrastructure and housing will help
entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs but none of it
will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those
jobs and that has to start at the earliest possible age
study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning the better he or she
does down the road but today fewer than 3 in 10 four year olds are enrolled in a high
quality preschool program most middle class parents canâ€™t afford a few hundred
bucks a week for private preschool and for poor kids who need help the most this
lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives
tonight i propose working with states to make high quality preschool available to
every child in america every dollar we invest in high quality early education can save
more than seven dollars later on by boosting graduation rates reducing teen
pregnancy even reducing violent crime in states that make it a priority to educate our
youngest children like georgia or oklahoma studies show students grow up more
likely to read and do math at grade level graduate high school hold a job and form
more stable families of their own so letâ€™s do what works and make sure none of our
children start the race of life already behind letâ€™s give our kids that chance
letâ€™s also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job
right now countries like germany focus on graduating their high school students with
the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges so that theyâ€™re
ready for a job at schools like p tech in brooklyn a collaboration between new york
public schools the city university of new york and ibm students will graduate with
a high school diploma and an associate degree in computers or engineering
we need to give every american student opportunities like this four years ago we
started race to the top a competition that convinced almost every state to develop
smarter curricula and higher standards for about 1 percent of what we spend on
education each year tonight iâ€™m announcing a new challenge to redesign americaâ€™s
high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high tech economy
weâ€™ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers and
create classes that focus on science technology engineering and math the skills
todayâ€™s employers are looking for to fill jobs right now and in the future
now even with better high schools most young people will need some higher
education itâ€™s a simple fact the more education you have the more likely you are to
have a job and work your way into the middle class but today skyrocketing costs
price way too many young people out of a higher education or saddle them with
unsustainable debt
through tax credits grants and better loans we have made college more affordable for
millions of students and families over the last few years but taxpayers cannot continue
to subsidize the soaring cost of higher education colleges must do their part to keep
costs down and itâ€™s our job to make sure they do tonight i ask congress to change the
higher education act so that affordability and value are included in determining
which colleges receive certain types of federal aid and tomorrow my administration
will release a new â€œcollege scorecardâ€ that parents and students can use to compare
schools based on a simple criteria where you can get the most bang for your
educational buck
to grow our middle class our citizens must have access to the education and training
that todayâ€™s jobs require but we also have to make sure that america remains a place
where everyone whoâ€™s willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead
our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving hopeful
immigrants and right now leaders from the business labor law enforcement and
faith communities all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration
reform
real reform means strong border security and we can build on the progress my
administration has already made putting more boots on the southern border than at
any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years
real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship a path
that includes passing a background check paying taxes and a meaningful penalty
learning english and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here
legally
and real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods
reduce bureaucracy and attract the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will
help create jobs and grow our economy
in other words we know what needs to be done as we speak bipartisan groups in
both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill and i applaud their efforts now
letâ€™s get this done send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few
months and i will sign it right away
but we canâ€™t stop there we know our economy is stronger when our wives mothers
and daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace and free
from the fear of domestic violence today the senate passed the violence against
women act that joe biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago i urge the house to do
the same and i ask this congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to
their efforts and finally pass the paycheck fairness act this year
we know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest dayâ€™s work with honest
wages but today a full time worker making the minimum wage earns $1400 a year
even with the tax relief weâ€™ve put in place a family with two kids that earns the
minimum wage still lives below the poverty line thatâ€™s wrong thatâ€™s why since the
last time this congress raised the minimum wage nineteen states have chosen to bump
theirs even higher
tonight letâ€™s declare that in the wealthiest nation on earth no one who works full time
should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to $90 an hour
this single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families it could mean
the difference between groceries or the food bank rent or eviction scraping by or
finally getting ahead for businesses across the country it would mean customers with
more money in their pockets in fact working folks shouldnâ€™t have to wait year after
year for the minimum wage to go up while ceo pay has never been higher so hereâ€™s
an idea that governor romney and i actually agreed on last year letâ€™s tie the minimum
wage to the cost of living so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on
tonight letâ€™s also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter
how hard you work itâ€™s virtually impossible to get ahead factory towns decimated
from years of plants packing up inescapable pockets of poverty urban and rural
where young adults are still fighting for their first job america is not a place where
chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny and that is why we need to
build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb
them
letâ€™s offer incentives to companies that hire americans whoâ€™ve got what it takes to fill
that job opening but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a
chance letâ€™s put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run down
neighborhoods and this year my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the
hardest hit towns in america to get these communities back on their feet weâ€™ll work
with local leaders to target resources at public safety education and housing weâ€™ll
give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest and weâ€™ll work to strengthen
families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low income couples and
doing more to encourage fatherhood because what makes you a man isnâ€™t the ability
to conceive a child itâ€™s having the courage to raise one
stronger families stronger communities a stronger america it is this kind of
prosperity broad shared and built on a thriving middle class that has always been
the source of our progress at home it is also the foundation of our power and influence
throughout the world
tonight we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to
protect us because of them we can say with confidence that america will complete its
mission in afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al qaeda
already we have brought home 3300 of our brave servicemen and women this
spring our forces will move into a support role while afghan security forces take the
lead tonight i can announce that over the next year another 3400 american troops
will come home from afghanistan this drawdown will continue and by the end of
next year our war in afghanistan will be over
beyond 2014, americaâ€™s commitment to a unified and sovereign afghanistan will
endure but the nature of our commitment will change we are negotiating an
agreement with the afghan government that focuses on two missions training and
equipping afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos and
counter terrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al qaeda and their
affiliates
today the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self
different al qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged from the arabian
peninsula to africa the threat these groups pose is evolving but to meet this threat
we donâ€™t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy
other nations instead we will need to help countries like yemen libya and somalia
provide for their own security and help allies who take the fight to terrorists as we
have in mali and where necessary through a range of capabilities we will continue
to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to americans
as we do we must enlist our values in the fight that is why my administration has
worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our
counterterrorism operations throughout we have kept congress fully informed of our
efforts i recognize that in our democracy no one should just take my word that weâ€™re
doing things the right way so in the months ahead i will continue to engage with
congress to ensure not only that our targeting detention and prosecution of terrorists
remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances but that our
efforts are even more transparent to the american people and to the world
of course our challenges donâ€™t end with al qaeda america will continue to lead the
effort to prevent the spread of the worldâ€™s most dangerous weapons the regime in
north korea must know that they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting
their international obligations provocations of the sort we saw last night will only
isolate them further as we stand by our allies strengthen our own missile defense and
lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats
likewise the leaders of iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic
solution because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their
obligations and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear
weapon at the same time we will engage russia to seek further reductions in our
nuclear arsenals and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that
could fall into the wrong hands because our ability to influence others depends on our
willingness to lead
america must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber attacks we know
hackers steal peopleâ€™s identities and infiltrate private e mail we know foreign
countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets now our enemies are also
seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid our financial institutions and our air
traffic control systems we cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did
nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy
thatâ€™s why earlier today i signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber
defenses by increasing information sharing and developing standards to protect our
national security our jobs and our privacy now congress must act as well by
passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks
and deter attacks
even as we protect our people we should remember that todayâ€™s world presents not
only dangers but opportunities to boost american exports support american jobs
and level the playing field in the growing markets of asia we intend to complete
negotiations on a trans pacific partnership and tonight i am announcing that we will
launch talks on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership with
the european union because trade that is free and fair across the atlantic supports
millions of good paying american jobs
we also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us
all in many places people live on little more than a dollar a day so the united states
will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades by
connecting more people to the global economy and empowering women by giving our
young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping communities to
feed power and educate themselves by saving the worldâ€™s children from preventable
deaths and by realizing the promise of an aids free generation
above all america must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of
historic change i saw the power of hope last year in rangoon when aung san suu
kyi welcomed an american president into the home where she had been imprisoned
for years when thousands of burmese lined the streets waving american flags
including a man who said â€œthere is justice and law in the united states i want our
country to be like that
in defense of freedom we will remain the anchor of strong alliances from the americas
to africa from europe to asia in the middle east we will stand with citizens as they
demand their universal rights and support stable transitions to democracy the
process will be messy and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in
countries like egypt but we can and will insist on respect for the fundamental rights
of all people we will keep the pressure on a syrian regime that has murdered its own
people and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every syrian and we
will stand steadfast with israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace these are the
messages i will deliver when i travel to the middle east next month
all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous
places at great personal risk our diplomats our intelligence officers and the men and
women of the united states armed forces as long as iâ€™m commander in chief we
will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad and we will
maintain the best military in the world we will invest in new capabilities even as we
reduce waste and wartime spending we will ensure equal treatment for all service
members and equal benefits for their families gay and straight we will draw upon
the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters because women have proven under
fire that they are ready for combat we will keep faith with our veterans investing in
world class care including mental health care for our wounded warriors supporting
our military families and giving our veterans the benefits education and job
opportunities they have earned and i want to thank my wife michelle and dr. jill
biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they
serve us
but defending our freedom is not the job of our military alone we must all do our part
to make sure our god given rights are protected here at home that includes our most
fundamental right as citizens the right to vote when any americans no matter
where they live or what their party are denied that right simply because they canâ€™t
wait for five six seven hours just to cast their ballot we are betraying our ideals thatâ€™s
why tonight iâ€™m announcing a non partisan commission to improve the voting
experience in america and iâ€™m asking two long time experts in the field whoâ€™ve
recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for governor romneyâ€™s
campaign to lead it we can fix this and we will the american people demand it
and so does our democracy
of course what iâ€™ve said tonight matters little if we donâ€™t come together to protect our
most precious resource our children
it has been two months since newtown i know this is not the first time this country
has debated how to reduce gun violence but this time is different overwhelming
majorities of americans americans who believe in the 2nd amendment have come
together around commonsense reform like background checks that will make it
harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun senators of both parties are working
together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to
criminals police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive
ammunition magazines off our streets because they are tired of being outgunned
each of these proposals deserves a vote in congress if you want to vote no thatâ€™s your
choice but these proposals deserve a vote because in the two months since newtown
more than a thousand birthdays graduations and anniversaries have been stolen from
our lives by a bullet from a gun
one of those we lost was a young girl named hadiya pendleton she was 15 years old
she loved fig newtons and lip gloss she was a majorette she was so good to her
friends they all thought they were her best friend just three weeks ago she was here
in washington with her classmates performing for her country at my inauguration
and a week later she was shot and killed in a chicago park after school just a mile
away from my house
hadiyaâ€™s parents nate and cleo are in this chamber tonight along with more than two
dozen americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence they deserve a
vote
gabby giffords deserves a vote
the families of newtown deserve a vote
the families of aurora deserve a vote
the families of oak creek and tucson and blacksburg and the countless other
communities ripped open by gun violence they deserve a simple vote
our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country indeed no
laws no initiatives no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges iâ€™ve
outlined tonight but we were never sent here to be perfect we were sent here to make
what difference we can to secure this nation expand opportunity and uphold our
ideals through the hard often frustrating but absolutely necessary work of self
government
we were sent here to look out for our fellow americans the same way they look out for
one another every single day usually without fanfare all across this country we
should follow their example
we should follow the example of a new york city nurse named menchu sanchez
when hurricane sandy plunged her hospital into darkness her thoughts were not with
how her own home was faring they were with the twenty precious newborns in her
care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe
we should follow the example of a north miami woman named desiline victor when
she arrived at her polling place she was told the wait to vote might be six hours and
as time ticked by her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet but whether
folks like her would get to have their say hour after hour a throng of people stayed in
line in support of her because desiline is 102 years old and they erupted in cheers
when she finally put on a sticker that read â€œi voted
we should follow the example of a police officer named brian murphy when a
gunman opened fire on a sikh temple in wisconsin and brian was the first to arrive he
did not consider his own safety he fought back until help arrived and ordered his
fellow officers to protect the safety of the americans worshiping inside even as he lay
bleeding from twelve bullet wounds
when asked how he did that brian said â€œthatâ€™s just the way weâ€™re made
thatâ€™s just the way weâ€™re made
we may do different jobs and wear different uniforms and hold different views than
the person beside us but as americans we all share the same proud title
we are citizens itâ€™s a word that doesnâ€™t just describe our nationality or legal status it
describes the way weâ€™re made it describes what we believe it captures the enduring
idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another
and to future generations that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others and
that well into our third century as a nation it remains the task of us all as citizens of
these united states to be the authors of the next great chapter in our american story
thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america
