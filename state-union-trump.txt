tonight as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of black history month we are reminded of our nationâ€™s path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done applause recent threats targeting jewish community centers and vandalism of jewish cemeteries as well as last weekâ€™s shooting in kansas city remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms applause each american generation passes the torch of truth liberty and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present that torch is now in our hands and we will use it to light up the world i am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart a new chapter â€” applause â€” of american greatness is now beginning a new national pride is sweeping across our nation and a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp what we are witnessing today is the renewal of the american spirit our allies will find that america is once again ready to lead applause all the nations of the world â€” friend or foe â€” will find that america is strong america is proud and america is free in nine years the united states will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding â€” 250 years since the day we declared our independence it will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world but what will america look like as we reach our 250th year what kind of country will we leave for our childreni will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future for too long weâ€™ve watched our middle class shrink as weâ€™ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries weâ€™ve financed and built one global project after another but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of chicago baltimore detroit and so many other places throughout our land weâ€™ve defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate and weâ€™ve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled then in 2016 the earth shifted beneath our feet the rebellion started as a quiet protest spoken by families of all colors and creeds â€” families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns but then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together from cities small and large all across our country finally the chorus became an earthquake and the people turned out by the tens of millions and they were all united by one very simple but crucial demand: that america must put its own citizens first because only then can we truly make america great again applause dying industries will come roaring back to life heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads bridges tunnels airports and railways gleaming across our very very beautiful land our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop and our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope safety and opportunity above all else we will keep our promises to the american people applause itâ€™s been a little over a month since my inauguration and i want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress iâ€™ve made in keeping those promises since my election ford fiatchrysler general motors sprint softbank lockheed intel walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the united states and will create tens of thousands of new american jobs applause the stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on november 8th a record weâ€™ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of a fantastic â€” and it is a fantastic â€” new f35 jet fighter and weâ€™ll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government we have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers we have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a fiveyear ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban â€” applause â€” thank you â€” and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government we have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce jobcrushing regulations creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency applause and weâ€™re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation two old regulations must be eliminated applause weâ€™re going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners applause we have cleared the way for the construction of the keystone and dakota access pipelines â€” applause â€” thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs and iâ€™ve issued a new directive that new american pipelines be made with american steel applause we have withdrawn the united states from the jobkilling transpacific partnership applause and with the help of prime minister justin trudeau we have formed a council with our neighbors in canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams applause to protect our citizens i have directed the department of justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime i have further ordered the departments of homeland security and justice along with the department of state and the director of national intelligence to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation applause we will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted applause at the same time my administration has answered the pleas of the american people for immigration enforcement and border security applause by finally enforcing our immigration laws we will raise wages help the unemployed save billions and billions of dollars and make our communities safer for everyone applause we want all americans to succeed but that canâ€™t happen in an environment of lawless chaos we must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders applause for that reason we will soon begin the construction of a great great wall along our southern border applause as we speak tonight we are removing gang members drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens bad ones are going out as i speak and as i promised throughout the campaign to any in congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws i would ask you this one question: what would you say to the american family that loses their jobs their income or their loved one because america refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders applause our obligation is to serve protect and defend the citizens of the united states we are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical islamic terrorism applause according to data provided by the department of justice the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorismrelated offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country we have seen the attacks at home â€” from boston to san bernardino to the pentagon and yes even the world trade center we have seen the attacks in france in belgium in germany and all over the world it is not compassionate but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur applause those given the high honor of admission to the united states should support this country and love its people and its values we cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside america we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists applause that is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep out those out who will do us harm applause as promised i directed the department of defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy isis â€” a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered muslims and christians and men and women and children of all faiths and all beliefs we will work with our allies including our friends and allies in the muslim world to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet applause i have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support iranâ€™s ballistic missile program and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of israel applause finally i have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the united states supreme court from my list of 20 judges who will defend our constitution applause i am greatly honored to have maureen scalia with us in the gallery tonight applause thank you maureen her late great husband antonin scalia will forever be a symbol of american justice to fill his seat we have chosen judge neil gorsuch a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law he was confirmed unanimously by the court of appeals and i am asking the senate to swiftly approve his nomination applause tonight as i outline the next steps we must take as a country we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited ninetyfour million americans are out of the labor force over 43 million people are now living in poverty and over 43 million americans are on food stamps more than one in five people in their prime working years are not working we have the worst financial recovery in 65 years in the last eight years the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined weâ€™ve lost more than onefourth of our manufacturing jobs since nafta was approved and weâ€™ve lost 60000 factories since china joined the world trade organization in 2001 our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars and overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party it will require us to tap into the american spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history but to accomplish our goals at home and abroad we must restart the engine of the american economy â€” making it easier for companies to do business in the united states and much much harder for companies to leave our country applause right now american companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world my economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone applause it will be a big big cut at the same time we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class we must create a level playing field for american companies and our workers we have to do it applause currently when we ship products out of america many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes but when foreign companies ship their products into america we charge them nothing or almost nothing i just met with officials and workers from a great american company harleydavidson in fact they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles made in the usa on the front lawn of the white house laughter and applause and they wanted me to ride one and i said â€œno thank you â€ laughter at our meeting i asked them how are you doing how is business they said that itâ€™s good i asked them further how are you doing with other countries mainly international sales they told me â€” without even complaining because they have been so mistreated for so long that theyâ€™ve become used to it â€” that itâ€™s very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate they said that in the case of another country they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent they werenâ€™t even asking for a change but i am applause i believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade itâ€™s been a long time since we had fair trade the first republican president abraham lincoln warned that the â€œabandonment of the protective policy by the american governmentâ€¦ will produce want and ruin among our people â€ lincoln was right â€” and itâ€™s time we heeded his advice and his words applause i am not going to let america and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer they have taken advantage of our country no longer applause i am going to bring back millions of jobs protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration applause the current outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers nations around the world like canada australia and many others have a meritbased immigration system applause itâ€™s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially yet in america we do not enforce this rule straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon according to the national academy of sciences our current immigration system costs american taxpayers many billions of dollars a year switching away from this current system of lowerskilled immigration and instead adopting a meritbased system we will have so many more benefits it will save countless dollars raise workersâ€™ wages and help struggling families â€” including immigrant families â€” enter the middle class and they will do it quickly and they will be very very happy indeed applause i believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for americans to strengthen our nationâ€™s security and to restore respect for our laws if we are guided by the wellbeing of american citizens then i believe republicans and democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades applause another republican president dwight d eisenhower initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program â€” the building of the interstate highway system the time has come for a new program of national rebuilding applause america has spent approximately $6 trillion in the middle east â€” all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling with this $6 trillion we could have rebuilt our country twice and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate applause to launch our national rebuilding i will be asking congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the united states â€” financed through both public and private capital â€” creating millions of new jobs applause this effort will be guided by two core principles: buy american and hire american applause tonight i am also calling on this congress to repeal and replace obamacare â€” applause â€” with reforms that expand choice increase access lower costs and at the same time provide better healthcare applause mandating every american to buy governmentapproved health insurance was never the right solution for our country applause the way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance and that is what we are going do applause obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits as an example arizona went up 116 percent last year alone governor matt bevin of kentucky just said obamacare is failing in his state â€” the state of kentucky â€” and itâ€™s unsustainable and collapsing onethird of counties have only one insurer and they are losing them fast they are losing them so fast they are leaving and many americans have no choice at all thereâ€™s no choice left remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan we now know that all of those promises have been totally broken obamacare is collapsing and we must act decisively to protect all americans applause action is not a choice it is a necessity so i am calling on all democrats and republicans in congress to work with us to save americans from this imploding obamacare disaster applause here are the principles that should guide the congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all americans:first we should ensure that americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges applause secondly we should help americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts â€” but it must be the plan they want not the plan forced on them by our government applause thirdly we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with medicaid to make sure no one is left out applause fourth we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately applause and finally the time has come to give americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines â€” applause â€” which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care so important everything that is broken in our country can be fixed every problem can be solved and every hurting family can find healing and hope our citizens deserve this and so much more â€” so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right applause on this and so many other things democrats and republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the american people applause my administration wants to work with members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave â€” applause â€” to invest in womenâ€™s health and to promote clean air and clean water and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure applause true love for our people requires us to find common ground to advance the common good and to cooperate on behalf of every american child who deserves a much brighter future an incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all today is rare disease day and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor megan crowley applause megan was diagnosed with pompe disease a rare and serious illness when she was 15 months old she was not expected to live past five on receiving this news meganâ€™s dad john fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child he founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved meganâ€™s life today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at notre dame applause meganâ€™s story is about the unbounded power of a fatherâ€™s love for a daughter but our slow and burdensome approval process at the food and drug administration keeps too many advances like the one that saved meganâ€™s life from reaching those in need if we slash the restraints not just at the fda but across our government then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like megan applause in fact our children will grow up in a nation of miracles but to achieve this future we must enrich the mind and the souls of every american child education is the civil rights issue of our time applause i am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth including millions of african american and latino children applause these families should be free to choose the public private charter magnet religious or home school that is right for them applause joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman denisha merriweather as a young girl denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice but then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning â€” a great learning center â€” with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program today she is the first in her family to graduate not just from high school but from college later this year she will get her masterâ€™s degree in social work we want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like denisha applause but to break the cycle of poverty we must also break the cycle of violence the murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest singleyear increase in nearly half a century in chicago more than 4000 people were shot last year alone and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher this is not acceptable in our society applause every american child should be able to grow up in a safe community to attend a great school and to have access to a highpaying job applause but to create this future we must work with not against â€” not against â€” the men and women of law enforcement applause we must build bridges of cooperation and trust â€” not drive the wedge of disunity and really itâ€™s what it is division itâ€™s pure unadulterated division we have to unify police and sheriffs are members of our community theyâ€™re friends and neighbors theyâ€™re mothers and fathers sons and daughters â€” and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not theyâ€™ll come home safe and sound we must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement applause and we must support the victims of crime i have ordered the department of homeland security to create an office to serve american victims the office is called voice â€” victims of immigration crime engagement we are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests applause joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave americans whose government failed them their names are jamiel shaw susan oliver jenna oliver and jessica davis jamielâ€™s 17yearold son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison jamiel shaw jr was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback but he never got the chance his father who is in the audience tonight has become a very good friend of mine jamiel thank you thank you applause also with us are susan oliver and jessica davis their husbands deputy sheriff danny oliver and detective michael davis were slain in the line of duty in california they were pillars of their community these brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations should have never been in our country sitting with susan is her daughter jenna jenna i want you to know that your father was a hero and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you applause to jamiel jenna susan and jessica i want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice your loved ones will never ever be forgotten we will always honor their memory applause finally to keep america safe we must provide the men and women of the united states military with the tools they need to prevent war â€” if they must â€” they have to fight and they only have to win applause i am sending congress a budget that rebuilds the military eliminates the defense sequester â€” applause â€” and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in american history my budget will also increase funding for our veterans our veterans have delivered for this nation and now we must deliver for them applause the challenges we face as a nation are great but our people are even greater and none are greater or braver than those who fight for america in uniform applause we are blessed to be joined tonight by carryn owens the widow of a u s navy special operator senior chief william â€œryanâ€ owens ryan died as he lived: a warrior and a hero battling against terrorism and securing our nation applause i just spoke to our great general mattis just now who reconfirmed that â€” and i quote â€” â€œryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies â€ ryanâ€™s legacy is etched into eternity thank you applause and ryan is looking down right now â€” you know that â€” and he is very happy because i think he just broke a record laughter and applause for as the bible teaches us â€œthere is no greater act of love than to lay down oneâ€™s life for oneâ€™s friends â€ ryan laid down his life for his friends for his country and for our freedom and we will never forget ryan applause to those allies who wonder what kind of a friend america will be look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform our foreign policy calls for a direct robust and meaningful engagement with the world it is american leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe we strongly support nato an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism and a cold war and defeated communism applause but our partners must meet their financial obligations and now based on our very strong and frank discussions they are beginning to do just that in fact i can tell you the money is pouring in very nice applause we expect our partners â€” whether in nato the middle east or in the pacific â€” to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations and pay their fair share of the cost have to do that we will respect historic institutions but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations and they have to respect our rights as a nation also applause free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people and america respects the right of all nations to chart their own path my job is not to represent the world my job is to represent the united states of america applause but we know that america is better off when there is less conflict not more we must learn from the mistakes of the past we have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world â€” all across the world the only longterm solution for these humanitarian disasters in many cases is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long long process of rebuilding applause america is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where shared interests align we want harmony and stability not war and conflict we want peace wherever peace can be found america is friends today with former enemies some of our closest allies decades ago fought on the opposite side of these terrible terrible wars this history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world hopefully the 250th year for america will see a world that is more peaceful more just and more free on our 100th anniversary in 1876 citizens from across our nation came to philadelphia to celebrate americaâ€™s centennial at that celebration the countryâ€™s builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations alexander graham bell displayed his telephone for the first time remington unveiled the first typewriter an early attempt was made at electric light thomas edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen imagine the wonders our country could know in americaâ€™s 250th year applause think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope american footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect and streets where mothers are safe from fear schools where children learn in peace and jobs where americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask applause when we have all of this we will have made america greater than ever before â€” for all americans this is our vision this is our mission but we can only get there together we are one people with one destiny we all bleed the same blood we all salute the same great american flag and we all are made by the same god applause when we fulfill this vision when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of american greatness began the time for small thinking is over the time for trivial fights is behind us we just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action from now on america will be empowered by our aspirations not burdened by our fears inspired by the future not bound by the failures of the past and guided by our vision not blinded by our doubts i am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the american spirit i am asking all members of congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country i am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment believe in yourselves believe in your future and believe once more in america thank you god bless you and god bless the united states mr speaker mr vice president members of congress the first lady of the united states and my fellow americans:less than 1 year has passed since i first stood at this podium in this majestic chamber to speak on behalf of the american people â€” and to address their concerns their hopes and their dreams that night our new administration had already taken swift action a new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land each day since we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission â€” to make america great again for all americans over the last year we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success we have faced challenges we expected and others we could never have imagined we have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship we endured floods and fires and storms but through it all we have seen the beauty of americaâ€™s soul and the steel in americaâ€™s spine each test has forged new american heroes to remind us who we are and show us what we can be we saw the volunteers of the â€œcajun navyâ€ racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane we saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the las vegas strip we heard tales of americans like coast guard petty officer ashlee leppert who is here tonight in the gallery with melania ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in houston during hurricane harvey through 18 hours of wind and rain ashlee braved live power lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives thank you ashlee we heard about americans like firefighter david dahlberg he is here with us too david faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a california summer camp threatened by wildfires to everyone still recovering in texas florida louisiana puerto rico the virgin islands california and everywhere else â€” we are with you we love you and we will pull through together some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally with us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this house â€” a guy who took a bullet almost died and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from louisiana congressman steve scalise we are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the capitol police officers the alexandria police and the doctors nurses and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others in this room in the aftermath of that terrible shooting we came together not as republicans or democrats but as representatives of the people but it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy tonight i call upon all of us to set aside our differences to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve over the last year the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on earth are so fearless or daring or determined as americans if there is a mountain we climb it if there is a frontier we cross it if there is a challenge we tame it if there is an opportunity we seize it so let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our union is strong because our people are strong and together we are building a safe strong and proud america since the election we have created 2 4 million new jobs including 200000 new jobs in manufacturing alone after years of wage stagnation we are finally seeing rising wages unemployment claims have hit a 45year low africanamerican unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded and hispanic american unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history small business confidence is at an alltime high the stock market has smashed one record after another gaining $8 trillion in value that is great news for americansâ€™ 401k retirement pension and college savings accounts and just as i promised the american people from this podium 11 months ago we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in american history our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses to lower tax rates for hardworking americans we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone now the first $24000 earned by a married couple is completely taxfree we also doubled the child tax credit a typical family of four making $75000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2000 â€” slashing their tax bill in half this april will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system â€” and millions of americans will have more takehome pay starting next month we eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on americans making less than $50000 a year â€” forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford governmentordered health plans we repealed the core of disastrous obamacare â€” the individual mandate is now gone we slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent so american companies can compete and win against anyone in the world these changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4000 small businesses have also received a massive tax cut and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income here tonight are steve staub and sandy keplinger of staub manufacturing â€” a small business in ohio they have just finished the best year in their 20year history because of tax reform they are handing out raises hiring an additional 14 people and expanding into the building next door one of staubâ€™s employees corey adams is also with us tonight corey is an allamerican worker he supported himself through high school lost his job during the 2008 recession and was later hired by staub where he trained to become a welder like many hardworking americans corey plans to invest his taxâ€‘cut raise into his new home and his two daughtersâ€™ education please join me in congratulating corey since we passed tax cuts roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses â€” many of them thousands of dollars per worker apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in america and hire another 20000 workers this is our new american moment there has never been a better time to start living the american dream so to every citizen watching at home tonight â€” no matter where you have been or where you come from this is your time if you work hard if you believe in yourself if you believe in america then you can dream anything you can be anything and together we can achieve anything tonight i want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have and what kind of nation we are going to be all of us together as one team one people and one american family we all share the same home the same heart the same destiny and the same great american flag together we are rediscovering the american way in america we know that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the center of the american life our motto is â€œin god we trust â€and we celebrate our police our military and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support here tonight is preston sharp a 12yearold boy from redding california who noticed that veteransâ€™ graves were not marked with flags on veterans day he decided to change that and started a movement that has now placed 40000 flags at the graves of our great heroes preston: a job well done young patriots like preston teach all of us about our civic duty as americans prestonâ€™s reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us why we salute our flag why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance and why we proudly stand for the national anthem americans love their country and they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return for the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government working with the senate we are appointing judges who will interpret the constitution as written including a great new supreme court justice and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country we are defending our second amendment and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty and we are serving our brave veterans including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions last year the congress passed and i signed the landmark va accountability act since its passage my administration has already removed more than 1500 va employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve â€” and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do i will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey all americans deserve accountability and respect â€” and that is what we are giving them so tonight i call on the congress to empower every cabinet secretary with the authority to reward good workers â€” and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the american people in our drive to make washington accountable we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history we have ended the war on american energy â€” and we have ended the war on clean coal we are now an exporter of energy to the world in detroit i halted government mandates that crippled americaâ€™s autoworkers â€” so we can get the motor city revving its engines once again many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the united states â€” something we have not seen for decades chrysler is moving a major plant from mexico to michigan toyota and mazda are opening up a plant in alabama soon plants will be opening up all over the country this is all news americans are unaccustomed to hearing â€” for many years companies and jobs were only leaving us but now they are coming back exciting progress is happening every day to speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs last year the fda approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history we also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives people who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure â€” i want to give them a chance right here at home it is time for the congress to give these wonderful americans the â€œright to try â€one of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs in many other countries these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the united states that is why i have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities prices will come down america has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies our jobs and our nationâ€™s wealth the era of economic surrender is over from now on we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal we will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones and we will protect american workers and american intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules as we rebuild our industries it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure america is a nation of builders we built the empire state building in just 1 year â€” is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple roadi am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe fast reliable and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve tonight i am calling on the congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1 5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and where appropriate tapping into private sector investment â€” to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process â€” getting it down to no more than two years and perhaps even one together we can reclaim our building heritage we will build gleaming new roads bridges highways railways and waterways across our land and we will do it with american heart american hands and american grit we want every american to know the dignity of a hard dayâ€™s work we want every child to be safe in their home at night and we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love we can lift our citizens from welfare to work from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity as tax cuts create new jobs let us invest in workforce development and job training let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential and let us support working families by supporting paid family leave as america regains its strength this opportunity must be extended to all citizens that is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance struggling communities especially immigrant communities will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of american workers and american families for decades open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities they have allowed millions of lowwage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest americans most tragically they have caused the loss of many innocent lives here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: evelyn rodriguez freddy cuevas elizabeth alvarado and robert mickens their two teenage daughters â€” kayla cuevas and nisa mickens â€” were close friends on long island but in september 2016 on the eve of nisaâ€™s 16th birthday neither of them came home these two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown six members of the savage gang ms13 have been charged with kayla and nisaâ€™s murders many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors â€‘ and wound up in kayla and nisaâ€™s high school evelyn elizabeth freddy and robert: tonight everyone in this chamber is praying for you everyone in america is grieving for you and 320 million hearts are breaking for you we cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain tonight i am calling on the congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed ms13 and other criminals to break into our country we have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ice and border patrol agents so that this cannot ever happen again the united states is a compassionate nation we are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy the struggling and the underprivileged all over the world but as president of the united states my highest loyalty my greatest compassion and my constant concern is for americaâ€™s children americaâ€™s struggling workers and americaâ€™s forgotten communities i want our youth to grow up to achieve great things i want our poor to have their chance to rise so tonight i am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties â€” democrats and republicans â€” to protect our citizens of every background color religion and creed my duty and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber is to defend americans â€” to protect their safety their families their communities and their right to the american dream because americans are dreamers too here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country: homeland security investigations special agent celestino martinez â€” he goes by cj cj served 15 years in the air force before becoming an ice agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets at one point ms13 leaders ordered cjâ€™s murder but he did not cave to threats or fear last may he commanded an operation to track down gang members on long island his team has arrested nearly 400 including more than 220 from ms13 cj: great work now let us get the congress to send you some reinforcements over the next few weeks the house and senate will be voting on an immigration reform package in recent months my administration has met extensively with both democrats and republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform based on these discussions we presented the congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise â€” one where nobody gets everything they want but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs here are the four pillars of our plan:the first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1 8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age â€” that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration under our plan those who meet education and work requirements and show good moral character will be able to become full citizens of the united states the second pillar fully secures the border that means building a wall on the southern border and it means hiring more heroes like cj to keep our communities safe crucially our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country â€” and it finally ends the dangerous practice of â€œcatch and release â€the third pillar ends the visa lottery â€” a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill merit or the safety of our people it is time to begin moving towards a meritbased immigration system â€” one that admits people who are skilled who want to work who will contribute to our society and who will love and respect our country the fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration under the current broken system a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives under our plan we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children this vital reform is necessary not just for our economy but for our security and our future in recent weeks two terrorist attacks in new york were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration in the age of terrorism these programs present risks we can no longer afford it is time to reform these outdated immigration rules and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century these four pillars represent a downthemiddle compromise and one that will create a safe modern and lawful immigration system for over 30 years washington has tried and failed to solve this problem this congress can be the one that finally makes it happen most importantly these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts america first so let us come together set politics aside and finally get the job done these reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction in 2016 we lost 64000 americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day seven per hour we must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge my administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need the struggle will be long and difficult â€” but as americans always do we will prevail as we have seen tonight the most difficult challenges bring out the best in america we see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the holets family of new mexico ryan holets is 27 years old and an officer with the albuquerque police department he is here tonight with his wife rebecca last year ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant homeless woman preparing to inject heroin when ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child she began to weep she told him she did not know where to turn but badly wanted a safe home for her baby in that moment ryan said he felt god speak to him: â€œyou will do it â€” because you can â€ he took out a picture of his wife and their four kids then he went home to tell his wife rebecca in an instant she agreed to adopt the holets named their new daughter hope ryan and rebecca: you embody the goodness of our nation thank you and congratulations as we rebuild americaâ€™s strength and confidence at home we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad around the world we face rogue regimes terrorist groups and rivals like china and russia that challenge our interests our economy and our values in confronting these dangers we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense for this reason i am asking the congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military as part of our defense we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal hopefully never having to use it but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons unfortunately we are not there yet last year i also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish isis from the face of the earth one year later i am proud to report that the coalition to defeat isis has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in iraq and syria but there is much more work to be done we will continue our fight until isis is defeated army staff sergeant justin peck is here tonight near raqqa last november justin and his comrade chief petty officer kenton stacy were on a mission to clear buildings that isis had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city clearing the second floor of a vital hospital kenton stacy was severely wounded by an explosion immediately justin bounded into the boobytrapped building and found kenton in bad shape he applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway he then performed cpr for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery kenton stacy would have died if not for justinâ€™s selfless love for a fellow warrior tonight kenton is recovering in texas raqqa is liberated and justin is wearing his new bronze star with a â€œvâ€ for â€œvalor â€ staff sergeant peck: all of america salutes you terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil when possible we annihilate them when necessary we must be able to detain and question them but we must be clear: terrorists are not merely criminals they are unlawful enemy combatants and when captured overseas they should be treated like the terrorists they are in the past we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists only to meet them again on the battlefield â€” including the isis leader albaghdadi so today i am keeping another promise i just signed an order directing secretary mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at guantÃ¡namo bay i am also asking the congress to ensure that in the fight against isis and alqaâ€™ida we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists â€” wherever we chase them down our warriors in afghanistan also have new rules of engagement along with their heroic afghan partners our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines and we no longer tell our enemies our plans last month i also took an action endorsed unanimously by the senate just months before: i recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel shortly afterwards dozens of countries voted in the united nations general assembly against americaâ€™s sovereign right to make this recognition american taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year that is why tonight i am asking the congress to pass legislation to help ensure american foreignassistance dollars always serve american interests and only go to americaâ€™s friends as we strengthen friendships around the world we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries when the people of iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship i did not stay silent america stands with the people of iran in their courageous struggle for freedom i am asking the congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible iran nuclear deal my administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in cuba and venezuela but no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in north korea north koreaâ€™s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland we are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation i will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position we need only look at the depraved character of the north korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to america and our allies otto warmbier was a hardworking student at the university of virginia on his way to study abroad in asia otto joined a tour to north korea at its conclusion this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state after a shameful trial the dictatorship sentenced otto to 15 years of hard labor before returning him to america last june â€” horribly injured and on the verge of death he passed away just days after his return ottoâ€™s parents fred and cindy warmbier are with us tonight â€” along with ottoâ€™s brother and sister austin and greta you are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world and your strength inspires us all tonight we pledge to honor ottoâ€™s memory with american resolve finally we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime his name is mr ji seongho in 1996 seongho was a starving boy in north korea one day he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food in the process he passed out on the train tracks exhausted from hunger he woke up as a train ran over his limbs he then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain his brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves â€” permanently stunting their own growth later he was tortured by north korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to china his tormentors wanted to know if he had met any christians he had â€” and he resolved to be free seongho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across china and southeast asia to freedom most of his family followed his father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death today he lives in seoul where he rescues other defectors and broadcasts into north korea what the regime fears the most â€‘ the truth today he has a new leg but seongho i understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all seonghoâ€™s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom it was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called america it was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness but it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves that they could chart their own destiny and that together they could light up the world that is what our country has always been about that is what americans have always stood for always strived for and always done atop the dome of this capitol stands the statue of freedom she stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her monuments to washington and jefferson â€” to lincoln and king memorials to the heroes of yorktown and saratoga â€” to young americans who shed their blood on the shores of normandy and the fields beyond and others who went down in the waters of the pacific and the skies over asia and freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one this capitol this living monument to the american people a people whose heroes live not only in the past but all around us â€” defending hope pride and the american way they work in every trade they sacrifice to raise a family they care for our children at home they defend our flag abroad they are strong moms and brave kids they are firefighters police officers border agents medics and marines but above all else they are americans and this capitol this city and this nation belong to them our task is to respect them to listen to them to serve them to protect them and to always be worthy of them americans fill the world with art and music they push the bounds of science and discovery and they forever remind us of what we should never forget: the people dreamed this country the people built this country and it is the people who are making america great again as long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for there is nothing we cannot achieve as long as we have confidence in our values faith in our citizens and trust in our god we will not fail our families will thrive our people will prosper and our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free thank you and god bless america
